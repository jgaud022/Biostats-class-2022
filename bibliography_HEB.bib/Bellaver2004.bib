abstract = {The aim of this work was to investigate the physiology of Kluyveromyces marxianus CBS 6556 in terms of its low tendency to form ethanol under exposure to sugar excess, and the split of carbon flux which takes place at the level of glucose-6-phosphate. Measurements were performed in batch cultivations, and after a glucose or a lactose pulse applied to chemostat-grown respiring cells (with a dilution rate of 0.1 h-1). No ethanol formation was observed in batch cultivations or during pulse experiments, unless the oxygen supply was shut down, indicating that this organism is more strictly Crabtree-negative than its close relative K. lactis and other known Crabtree-negative yeasts. During the pulse experiments, activities of phosphoglucoisomerase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and phosphoglucomutase in cell-free extracts remained rather constant, at higher levels than those of Saccharomyces cerevisiae grown at similar conditions. When cells were exposed to glucose concentrations as high as 26 gl-1, the activity of phosphoglucomutase was higher than that in cells exposed to 14 gl-1 glucose, whereas the activities of phosphoglucoisomerase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase did not change. Our results suggest that the low tendency for ethanol formation in K. marxianus might be a consequence of this yeast's capacity of keeping the glycolytic flux constant, due at least in part to the diversion of carbon flux towards the biosynthesis of carbohydrates and towards the pentose phosphate pathway. {\textcopyright} 2004 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.
