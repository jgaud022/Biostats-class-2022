abstract = {As part of a comparative genomics project on 13 hemiascomycetous yeasts, the Pichia angusta type strain was studied using a partial random sequencing strategy. With coverage of 0.5 genome equivalents, about 2500 novel protein-coding genes were identified, probably corresponding to more than half of the P. angusta protein-coding genes, 6{\%} of which do not have homologs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Some of them contain one or two introns, on average three times shorter than those in S. cerevisiae. We also identified 28 tRNA genes, a few retrotransposons similar to Ty5 of S. cerevisiae, solo long terminal repeats, the whole ribosomal DNA cluster, and segments of mitochondrial DNA. The P. angusta sequences were deposited in EMBL under the accession numbers AL430961 to AL436044. {\textcopyright} 2000 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.},
