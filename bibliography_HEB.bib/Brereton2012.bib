abstract = {The present study reports an improved method to quickly and reproducibly isolate the saccharides from a variety of dairy and soy products utilizing reversed-phase solid-phase extraction to quantitatively remove fats, fatty acids, and lipids followed by desalination and deproteinization by ion-exchange solid-phase extraction with no loss of saccharides during extraction. Analysis of the isolated saccharides was performed by ligand-exchange HPLC. The method presented requires no prolonged heating (thus protecting the saccharides from hydrolysis or isomerization), uses benign reagents, and realizes a significant time savings over existing methods. The isolation and analysis of monosaccharides (glucose, galactose and fructose), disaccharides (lactose and sucrose), and polysaccharides (raffinose and stachyose) from dairy products (whole, reduced fat, and lactose-free milk and yogurt), infant formula (powdered and premixed), and soy beverages were studied in this investigation with recoveries ranging from 88{\%} to 110{\%} in all products studied. We also applied the method to quickly discriminate authentic soy milk from a soy beverage, branded as soy milk. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},
