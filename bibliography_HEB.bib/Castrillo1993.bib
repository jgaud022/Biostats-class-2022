abstract = {The influence of physiological parameters such as carbon substrate flux and O2 uptake rates on energy metabolism are reported with reference to biomass productivity in whey chemostat culture. The combined results show that oxidoreductive energy metabolism may be attained independently of the yeast reaching its maximum respiratory capacity. A novel metabolic interpretation is presented proposing that a relative imbalance between glycolysis and subsequent oxidative steps alone is sufficient to account for the observed results. By means of a mathematical model the results could be reproduced under all experimental conditions. The new interpretation provides an insight into the manner in which energy mettbolism is regulated and influences growth-related process Kluyveromyces marxianus, as well as other yeasts with similar physiological characteristics. {\textcopyright} 1993 Springer-Verlag.},
