abstract = {Glacial ice covered the Chalk River area through most of the Wisconsin Stage. About 11 300 yr ago, an ice retreat was followed immediately by a short incursion of Champlain Sea waters, which deposited at least 2.5m of clay, silt, and sand. A local readvance, probably associated with the St. Narcisse event, deposited till on the marine sediments. Following the final retreat of the ice from the area, lacustrine and aeolian deposition occurred locally for a short time. About 10 500 yr ago, the N Bay drainage route opened, greatly increasing the discharge of the Ottawa River. A faint terrace at a present elevation of 209m probably formed at this time. Changes in the drainage routes of proglacial lakes and in the rate of ice retreat caused a general decrease in discharge rates, and resulted in the formation of pronounced terraces. By about 5000 yr BP, the N Bay outlet closed, and the river fell to approximately 111m, its present elevation at Chalk River. -from Authors},
