abstract = {Experiments were carried out to study the effect of distillery sludge amendments with garden soil (10, 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100{\%}) on seed germination and growth parameters of Phaseolus mungo L. Germination percentage and index values decreased with rise in sludge concentration. Soil amended with 10{\%} (w/w) sludge showed favorable growth while {\textgreater}10{\%} was inhibitory for plant growth. Soil amended with 10{\%} (w/w) distillery sludge induced the growth in root length, shoot length, number of leaves, biomass, photosynthetic pigment, protein and starch while 20{\%} (w/w) sludge amended soil had variable effects on the root, shoot, leaves and nodules of P. mungo L. At concentrations ({\textgreater}40{\%}) reduced all the growth parameters, viz., root length, shoot length, number of leaves, biomass, photosynthetic pigment, protein and starch of P. mungo. Malondialdehyde (MDA) product of lipid peroxidation was also enhanced in both root and leaves of sludge amended soil grown P. mungo at all the sludge amendments and exposure periods. A coordinated increase in cysteine, non-protein thiol and ascorbic acid antioxidants was up to 40 days of growth. After this period a decrease was observed. The N, P, K and Mg accumulation followed the order shoot {\textgreater} leaf {\textgreater} root. Calcium accumulation was highest in the upper part of the plants (including shoot and leaves). Furthermore, heavy metals content were also increased in different parts of P. mungo grown on increasing concentration of sludge amended garden soil with time. Zinc and copper accumulation was maximum versus other heavy metals. Based on these studies, sludge having concentrations â‰¤10{\%} (w/w) can be applied as a fertilizer. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},
