abstract = {An alcoholic beverage (35.4{\%} v/v ethanol) was produced by distillation of the fermented broth obtained by continuous whey fermentation with a lactose-fermenting yeast Kluyveromyces marxianus. Forty volatile compounds were identified in this drink by gas chromatography. Higher alcohols were the most abundant group of volatile compounds present, with isoamyl, isobutyl, 1-propanol, and isopentyl alcohols being found in highest quantities (887, 542, 266, and 176 mg/l, respectively). Ethyl acetate had the highest concentration (138 mg/l) among the esters. Besides higher alcohols and esters, other components, including aldehydes, acids and terpenes were also identified in the whey spirit. Considering that the quality of an alcoholic beverage can be evaluated by the relation between isoamyl alcohol/2-methyl-1-propanol and 2-methyl-1-propanol/1-propanol, which have to be higher than unity, it was concluded that a novel spirit of acceptable organoleptic characteristics can be produced by cheese whey continuous fermentation with K. marxianus. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
