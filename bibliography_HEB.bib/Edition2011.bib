abstract = {{\textless}div{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Since it was first published in 1991, {\textless}em{\textgreater}Guide to California Planning{\textless}/em{\textgreater} has served as the authoritative textbook on city and county planning practice throughout the state. The first book ever written that covers all aspects of planning in a single state, {\textless}em{\textgreater}Guide to California Planning{\textless}/em{\textgreater} is used as a textbook in virtually every college- and graduate- level planning program in California.{\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}In this revised and expanded fourth edition, William Fulton and Paul Shigley lay out planning laws and processes in detail and describe how planning really works in California - how cities and counties and developers and citizen groups all interact with each other on a daily basis to shape California communities and the California landscape, for better and for worse. Significant new topics addressed in this edition include the state's increasing focus on smart growth, infill, and transit-oriented development and ways of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.{\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}Easy to read and understand, {\textless}em{\textgreater}Guide to California Planning{\textless}/em{\textgreater} is far more than a textbook. It's an ideal tool for planning professionals, members of allied professions in the planning and development fields, and citizen activists.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/div{\textgreater}},
