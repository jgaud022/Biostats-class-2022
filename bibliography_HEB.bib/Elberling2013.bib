abstract = {Thawing permafrost represents a poorly understood feedback mechanism of climate change in the Arctic, but with a potential impact owing to stored carbon being mobilized1–5. We have quantified the long-term loss of carbon (C) from thawing permafrost in Northeast Greenland from 1996 to 2008 by combining repeated sediment sampling to assess changes in C stock and {\textgreater}12 years of CO2 production in incubated permafrost samples. Field observations show that the active- layer thickness has increased by {\textgreater}1cmyr−1 but thawing has not resulted in a detectable decline in C stocks. Laboratory mineralization rates at 5 ◦C resulted in a C loss between 9 and 75{\%}, depending on drainage, highlighting the potential of fast mobilization of permafrost C under aerobic conditions, but also that C at near-saturated conditions may remain largely immobilized over decades. This is confirmed by a three-pool C dynamics model that projects a potential C loss between 13 and 77{\%}for 50 years of incubation at 5 ◦C},
