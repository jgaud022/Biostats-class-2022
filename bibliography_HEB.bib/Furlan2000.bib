abstract = {A lactose-free, low-cost culture medium for the production of $\beta$-D- galactosidase by Kluyveromyces marxianus was formulated. At high aeration rates (2.2 vvm) and concentrations of 100 g sugar cane molasses l-1 as carbon source and 100 g corn steep liquor l-1 as vitamin and nitrogen source an enzyme production of 708 U l-1 h was achieved. This was 20{\%} higher than using a medium that contained lactose which is considered the primary inductor of $\beta$-D-galactosidase synthesis.},
