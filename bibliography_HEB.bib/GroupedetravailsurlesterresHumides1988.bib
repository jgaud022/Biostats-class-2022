abstract = {BACKGROUND: The cellular retinol binding protein I gene (CRBP) is downregulated in a subset of human breast cancers and in MMTV-Myc induced mouse mammary tumors. Functional studies suggest that CRBP downregulation contributes to breast tumor progression. What is the mechanism underlying CRBP downregulation in cancer? Here we investigated the hypothesis that CRBP is epigenetically silenced through DNA hypermethylation in human and mouse breast cancer. RESULTS: Bisulfite sequencing of CRBP in a panel of 6 human breast cancer cell lines demonstrated that, as a rule, CRBP hypermethylation is closely and inversely related to CRBP expression and identified one exception to this rule. Treatment with 5-azacytidine, a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, led to CRBP reexpression, supporting the hypothesis that CRBP hypermethylation is a proximal cause of CRBP silencing. In some cells CRBP reexpression was potentiated by co-treatment with retinoic acid, an inducer of CRBP, and trichostatin A, a histone deacetylase inhibitor. Southern blot analysis of a small panel of human breast cancer specimens identified one case characterized by extensive CRBP hypermethylation, in association with undetectable CRBP mRNA and protein. Bisulfite sequencing of CRBP in MMTV-Myc and MMTV-Neu/NT mammary tumor cell lines extended the rule of CRBP hypermethylation and silencing (both seen in MMTV-Myc but not MMTV-Neu/NT cells) from human to mouse breast cancer and suggested that CRBP hypermethylation is an oncogene-specific event. CONCLUSION: CRBP hypermethylation appears to be an evolutionarily conserved and principal mechanism of CRBP silencing in breast cancer. Based on the analysis of transgenic mouse mammary tumor cells, we hypothesize that CRBP silencing in human breast cancer may be associated with a specific oncogenic signature},
