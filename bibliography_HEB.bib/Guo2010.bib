abstract = {Ethanol productions from cheese whey powder (CWP) solution were investigated by using free or immobilized cells of Kluyveromyces marxianus in monocultures or mixed cultures with free or immobilized cells of K. marxianus and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. K. marxianus free cells produced 3.8{\%} v/v ethanol in monocultures, while S. cerevisiae immobilized cells produced 5.3{\%} v/v ethanol in mixed cultures. The percentage of theoretical yield was found to be higher in mixed cultures than that in monocultures. The maximum ethanol fermentation efficiency was achieved (79.9{\%} of the theoretical value) using mixed cultures of immobilized cells of K. marxianus and S. cerevisiae. The beads were relatively stable without significant reduction in activity for about eight batches of fermentation. {\textcopyright} 2008 Humana Press.},
