abstract = {The fermentation characteristics of the novel, thermotolerant, isolate Kluyveromyces marxianus var marxianus were determined to evaluate its aptitude for use in an ethanol production process. Sustainable growth was not observed under anaerobic conditions, even in the presence of unsaturated fatty acid and sterol. A maximum ethanol concentration of 40 g L-1 was produced at 45Â°C, with an initial specific ethanol production rate of 1.7 g g-1 h-1. This was observed at ethanol concentrations below 8 g L-1 and under oxygen-limited conditions. The low ethanol tolerance and low growth under oxygen-limited conditions required for ethanol production implied that a simple continuous process was not feasible with this yeast strain. Improved productivity was achieved through recycling biomass into the fermenter, indicating that utilising an effective cell retention method such as cell recycle or immobilisation, could lead to the development of a viable industrial process using this novel yeast strain.},
