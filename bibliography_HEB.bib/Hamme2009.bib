abstract = {Unsupplemented acid goat whey containing 096{\%} protein and 276{\%} lactose was fermented aerobically with 32 microflora extracted from various raw milk cheeses and dairy products. These microflora were screened for their ability to hydrolyse whey proteins (-lactalbumin and/or -lactoglobulin) and to generate peptides inhibitors of Angiotensin I Converting Enzyme. Five microflora were able to degrade whey protein. The most efficient microflora was able to fully hydrolyse -lactalbumin and to a lesser extend -lactoglobulin. It was extracted from Bamalou des Pyrenes cheese. Micro-organisms involved consisted of yeast Kluyveromyces marxianus and lactobacillus Lactobacillus rhamnosus. Both were able to produce ACE inhibitory peptides after whey fermentation. {\textcopyright} Proprietors of Journal of Dairy Research 2009.},
