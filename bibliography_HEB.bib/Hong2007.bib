abstract = {Kluyveromyces marxianus NBRC1777 was identified as a thermotolerant yeast and was developed as a host for the expression of thermostable cellulase genes. The previously isolated genes for thermostable endo-$\beta$-1,4-glucanase, cellobiohydrolase, and $\beta$-glucosidase were introduced into the chromosome of K. marxianus and successfully expressed under the control of high-expression promoters. The recombinant K. marxianus expressing cellulase genes became able to grow in synthetic medium containing cellobiose or carboxymethyl-cellulose as the single carbon source. Moreover, the recombinant strain produced 43.4 g/L ethanol from 10{\%} cellobiose. These results suggest that K. marxianus may afford a useful host system, which may be applicable to the simultaneous saccharification and fermentation and the foundation of cellulose consolidated bioprocessing. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.
