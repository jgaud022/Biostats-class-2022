abstract = {1. Each of the three forms of milk-sugar shows two heats of solution according as the rate of the balanced reaction that occurs in milk-sugar solutions proceeds very slowly or very rapidly.In the former case the initial heat of solution is observed, in the latter the final heat of solution, which is the sum of the initial heat of solution and the heat generated bv the rapidly progressing reaction, called the heat of passage. 2. The following data on these heat effects at 20° have been determined with a calorimeter.Hydrated milk-sugar. [formula omitted] 3. The equality of the heat of passage of the hydrate and the $\alpha$-anhydride is further evidence supporting the accepted view that the $\beta$-anhydride passes instantly to hydrate wrhen dissolved, which then slowly builds $\beta$-anhydride according to the balanced reaction [formula omitted] 4. Evidence from two independent sources shows that the initial heat of solution of the hydrate increases about 0.1 calorie per degree rise in temperature. 5. The dilution of strong milk-sugar solutions (0.5 molal) causes a very slight development of heat, which cannot be due to any change in the equilibrium of the balanced reaction with concentration because the heat development at room temperature on dilution is instantaneous while any change of the balanced reaction at this temperature would be very slow. The heat of solution is independent of the concentration when this is less than about 0.3 molal. 6. Pure $\beta$-anhydrous milk-sugar has been prepared by an improved method of slow crystallization, and a delicate test shows that it is free from hydrate.Its specific gravity at 20° is 1.59, that of the hydrate being 1.54. 7. The present data on the heats of solution confirm quantitatively the view that the crystalline substance which alcohol and ether precipitate from cold stable milk-sugar solutions is not a pure substance as was first supposed but is a mechanical mixture of the hydrate and the $\beta$-anhydride.It does not show mutarotation when redissolved in water because the two substances are present in it in the same proportions approximately in which they occur in stable solutions.8.When the temperature of a stable solution of milk-sugar is suddenly changed a slight thermal lag is observed in its rotatory power, which indicates that the hydration is slightly increased with rise of temperature between 0° and 100°.The direction and magnitude of this lag agree with the conclusions drawn from the observed value of the heat of passage.9.The final heat of solution of hydrated milk-sugar is calculated from the solubilities at 150° and 250° to be 0−11.5, agreeing with the calorimetric measurement at 200°, which gives 0−11.4. {\textcopyright} 1908, American Chemical Society.
