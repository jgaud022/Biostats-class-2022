abstract = {This paper presents studies of the contact between a soft rubber specimen and glass counterface using the Digital Speckle Correlation method, which provides information of displacements and structural similarities between recorded images. The setup is designed with a real contact and changes in the contact can be varied. Microscopic images using laser light illumination for different displacements are recorded and correlated. The results show that the contact area can be identiﬁ ed both for dry and lubricated contacts. The method can be applied on differ- ent geometries, surface roughness and lubricants. Inﬂ uences of scars and contaminations, e.g. wear particles, may also be analysed.},
