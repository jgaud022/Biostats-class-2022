abstract = {Cyanobacterial blooms are common in the Baltic Sea. They are dominated by Aphanizomenon flos-aquae and Nodularia spumigena and take place in July-August. Investigations of bloom development using different approaches have been carried out in the Gulf of Finland during recent years. The ship-of-opportunity technique allows to observe the upper layer dynamics from meso- to basin-wide scale with high temporal and spatial frequency at low cost. Unattended measurements on board a commercial ferry along a transect between Tallinn and Helsinki have been conducted for 3 years (1997-1999). The influence of weather conditions - temperature and wind - on the cyanobacterial bloom development was investigated. The formation of cyanobacterial blooms was favoured by warm and calm weather, while in cold and windy conditions other species formed mass occurrences. Water temperature has been found to be the main factor controlling the initiation of the bloom, in general, while vertical stratification appeared to be the critical factor determining the intensity of the bloom at species level. The spatial distribution of the cyanobacterial bloom was determined rather by the wind-forced advection than by the possible vertical transport of nutrients in the areas of the observed upwelling events. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.
