abstract = {A novel system for high-temperature alcoholic fermentation of whey is described. This system consists of Kluyveromyces marxianus yeast immobilized on delignified cellulosic material (DCM). The effect of pH, initial lactose concentration and temperature on the fermentation of a synthetic medium containing lactose was studied. Batch fermentations of whey were also carried out and the formation of volatile by-products was examined. The concentrations of higher alcohols were found to be in very low levels leading to a product of improved quality. The fermented whey had an improved characteristic aroma compared to unfermented whey. The possibility to use fermented whey as raw material for the production of a novel, low alcohol content drink was also investigated. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.
