abstract = {Distillery effluents, a major by-product of distilleries are a major environmental hazard as they are rich in organic matter, micro- and macroelements. Management of this enormous amount of nutrient-rich effluent and its effective utilization is a major challenge. These effluents can be used as a source of nutrient by C4 crops like sugarcane and subsequent ratoon crops under fertigation system. Impact of fertigation in sugarcane-ratoon cropping system on soil microbial biomass is important as the microbial population plays an important role in the nutrient and biogeochemical recycling. Keeping this in mind, a field experiment was carried out in the sandy loam soil of semi-arid to humid sub-tropical climate of Gajraula (28.85°N, 78.23°E) region, India with different doses of diluted and undiluted effluent for fertigation of sugarcane crop in presence and absence of 50 {\%} recommended dose of fertilizers with suitable replicates. Two post-sown irrigations with four times diluted effluent gave the maximum yield in case of sugarcane crop. Taking into consideration the yield and the culturable microbial population sizes, it can be concluded that one to two post-sown irrigations with diluted effluent can be used to enhance soil fertility in terms of microbial population and to enhance sugarcane and ratoon crop productivity. This package is economically viable and can also take care of distillery waste management and reduction in consumption of chemical fertilizers by 50 {\%}, a key for sustainable agricultural development.},
