abstract = {A brief outline of the current taxonomic status of the genus Kluyveromyces is presented. Noteworthy are the transfer of several former Kluyveromyces species to other genera, the retention of the name Kluyveromyces for K. lactis, K. marxianus, and four related species, and some recent attempts to clarify the variety status of strains assigned to K. lactis. {\textcopyright} 2007 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.},
