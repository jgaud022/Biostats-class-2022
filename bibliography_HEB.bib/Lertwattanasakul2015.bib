abstract = {Background: High-temperature fermentation technology with thermotolerant microbes has been expected to reduce the cost of bioconversion of cellulosic biomass to fuels or chemicals. Thermotolerant Kluyveromyces marxianus possesses intrinsic abilities to ferment and assimilate a wide variety of substrates including xylose and to efficiently produce proteins. These capabilities have been found to exceed those of the traditional ethanol producer Saccharomyces cerevisiae or lignocellulose-bioconvertible ethanologenic Scheffersomyces stipitis. Results: The complete genome sequence of K. marxianus DMKU 3-1042 as one of the most thermotolerant strains in the same species has been determined. A comparison of its genomic information with those of other yeasts and transcriptome analysis revealed that the yeast bears beneficial properties of temperature resistance, wide-range bioconversion ability, and production of recombinant proteins. The transcriptome analysis clarified distinctive metabolic pathways under three different growth conditions, static culture, high temperature, and xylose medium, in comparison to the control condition of glucose medium under a shaking condition at 30Â°C. Interestingly, the yeast appears to overcome the issue of reactive oxygen species, which tend to accumulate under all three conditions. Conclusions: This study reveals many gene resources for the ability to assimilate various sugars in addition to species-specific genes in K. marxianus, and the molecular basis of its attractive traits for industrial applications including high-temperature fermentation. Especially, the thermotolerance trait may be achieved by an integrated mechanism consisting of various strategies. Gene resources and transcriptome data of the yeast are particularly useful for fundamental and applied researches for innovative applications.},
