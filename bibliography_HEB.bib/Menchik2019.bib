abstract = {This article provides composition information for 3 abundantly available but little characterized dairy coproduct streams: acid whey from Greek yogurt (GAW), acid whey from cottage cheese (CAW), and milk permeate (MP). Three replicate samples obtained on different dates from several dairy processors were analyzed. The main component in all streams was lactose, with up to 3.5, 2.1, and 11.9{\%} in GAW, CAW, and MP, respectively. Crude protein content ranged from 1.71 to 3.71 mg/g in GAW, 1.65 to 5.05 mg/g in CAW, and 3.2 to 4.35 mg/g in MP, and pH ranged from 4.21 to 4.48, 4.35 to 4.51, and 5.4 to 6.37, respectively. Chemical oxygen demand varied from 52,400 to 62,400 mg/L for GAW, 31,900 to 40,000 mg/L for CAW, and 127000 to 142,000 mg/L for MP; biochemical oxygen demand ranged from 45,800 to 50,500 mg/L (GAW), 32,700 to 40,000 mg/L (CAW), and 110,000 to 182,000 mg/L (MP). The GAW had the lowest pH (4.21â€“4.48) and highest mineral content of all streams. These data will assist processors and researchers in developing value-added uses of these dairy coproducts.},
