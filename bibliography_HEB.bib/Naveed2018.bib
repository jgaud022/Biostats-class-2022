abstract = {The safe disposal of industrial effluents always remained a challenging process because of their high level of nutrients, toxic elements, and salts. A pot experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of various concentrations (5{\%}, 10{\%}, 15{\%}, and 20{\%}) of sugar industry effluent spentwash (SW) fertigated with tab water (TW), on soil properties, crop growth, physiological parameters, yield components, and accumulation of potentially toxic elements (PTEs) in rice (Oryza sativa L.) grains and straw. The results showed that soil physico-chemical properties were modified with rise in SW concentration. Application of 5{\%} SW significantly enhanced the plant growth, and yield components. Photosynthesis rate, transpiration rate, and stomatal conductance were significantly higher under 5{\%} SW concentration in comparison with control. However, SW concentrations of {\textgreater} 5{\%} showed inhibitory effects for all growth, physiological, and yield components. Accumulation of PTEs showed increasing trend with rise in SW concentration. However, under 5{\%} SW concentration, all the PTEs in rice grain and straw were within the permissible limits (PLs) recommended by FAO/WHO and no health hazards were detected by health risk assessment. Based on the study results, 5{\%} SW fertigation with TW can be applied as fertilizer for enhancing the growth and productivity of rice. [Figure not available: see fulltext.]},
