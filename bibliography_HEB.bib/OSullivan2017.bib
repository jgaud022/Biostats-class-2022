abstract = {This chapter describes the sensory quality and shelf life aspects of beverage products, which can be broadly separated into those that are alcoholic and nonalcoholic. Carbonated flavoured drinks may experience flavour fade over the course of sensory shelf life, whereas beverages such as wine and whiskey can actually improve with age. Microbiological shelf life is discussed because of its importance in nonalcoholic beverages and beer quality. However, this is less important for other alcoholic beverages, such as spirits, with higher alcohol levels due to the antimicrobial nature of ethanol thus sensory quality is the primary means of defining shelf life. Some beverages may also undergo rheological changes, such as cream liqueurs, which can increase in viscosity over time depending on storage temperature and emulsion stability.},
