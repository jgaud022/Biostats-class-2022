abstract = {In this work, 21 different alcoholic beverages (beer, wines and spirits) were analyzed by an electronic nose after a dehydration and dealcoholization procedure. Principal component analysis (PCA) and discriminant factorial analysis (DFA) allowed to clearly identify differences between these various alcoholic beverages and to classify them independent of their ethanol content. The PCA showed that the sample discrimination was carried out according to the content in aroma compounds. The discrimination quality was evaluated using the leave-one out method, which allowed to quantify the percentage of samples classed correctly for a determined number of sensors. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.
