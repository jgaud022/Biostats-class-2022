abstract = {The maximum volumetric productivity of $\beta$-galactosidase by a Kluyveromyces marxianus mutant, grown on lactose/corn steep liquor medium for 3 d, was 150 IU l-1 h-1 which is twice that of the parent organism. During product formation, mutated cells provided more resistance against thermal inactivation.},
