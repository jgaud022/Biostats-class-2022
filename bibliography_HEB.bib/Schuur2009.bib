abstract = {Permafrost soils in boreal and Arctic ecosystems store almost twice as much carbon 1,2 as is currently present in the atmosphere 3 . Permafrost thaw and the microbial decomposition of previously frozen organic carbon is considered one of the most likely positive climate feedbacks from terrestrial ecosystems to the atmosphere in a warmer world 1,2,4–7 . The rate of carbon release from permafrost soils is highly uncertain, but it is crucial for predicting the strength and timing of this carbon-cycle feedback effect, and thus how important permafrost thaw will be for climate change this century and beyond 1,2,4–7 . Sustained transfers of carbon to the atmosphere that could cause a significant positive feedback to climate change must come from old carbon, which forms the bulk of the perma-frost carbon pool that accumulated over thousands of years 8–11 . Here we measure net ecosystem carbon exchange and the radio-carbon age of ecosystem respiration in a tundra landscape under-going permafrost thaw 12 to determine the influence of old carbon loss on ecosystem carbon balance. We find that areas that thawed over the past 15 years had 40 per cent more annual losses of old carbon than minimally thawed areas, but had overall net eco-system carbon uptake as increased plant growth offset these losses. In contrast, areas that thawed decades earlier lost even more old carbon, a 78 per cent increase over minimally thawed areas; this old carbon loss contributed to overall net ecosystem carbon release despite increased plant growth. Our data document signifi-cant losses of soil carbon with permafrost thaw that, over decadal timescales, overwhelms increased plant carbon uptake 13–15 at rates that could make permafrost a large biospheric carbon source in a warmer world. We measured ecosystem carbon (C) dynamics at a tundra site in Alaska where permafrost thaw has been documented since 1990, and was occurring in the area before that time, probably owing to regional climate change 12 . The Eight Mile Lake watershed is located in the northern foothills of the Alaska Range (Supplementary Information and Supplementary Fig. 1). Permafrost temperature has been monitored annually on a gentle north-facing slope in a 30-m-deep borehole that was installed in 1985 before the permafrost started to thaw 12 . Although permafrost thaw can sometimes result in water ponding, depending on local topography 16,17 , this landscape consists largely of relatively well-drained uplands (Supplementary Fig. 2). Permafrost thaw at the local level occurs as a series of positive feed-backs between temperature change, ground subsidence, and hydro-logic redistribution that causes further thawing in a spatially heterogeneous pattern generated by water flow paths. In this water-shed, we monitored three sites that represented minimal, moderate and extensive amounts of change as a result of the duration of per-mafrost thaw, based on observations of ground subsidence, depth of thaw, historical ground temperature measurements, and historical and current photographs (Supplementary Table 1) 12,18–20},
