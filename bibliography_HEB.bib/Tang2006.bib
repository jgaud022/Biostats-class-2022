abstract = {The sugar mill based distillery effluent has become a challenge for environment protection. It is necessary to deal with this effluent eco-friendly and cost-effectively. The sugar mill based distillery effluent was used to mix with other fertilizers to form liquid fertilizer, which was applied to sugarcane. The rates of the liquid fertilizer were 7.5t/hm2, 15t/ hm2 and 22.5t/ hm2, which increased the yield of the sugarcane by 2.4t/ha, 5.915t/ha and 7.543t/ha respectively with rate of growth of 3.29-10.34{\%}, and increased the yield of sugar by 0.99t/ha, 1.165t/ha and 1.368t/ha, respectively with rate of growth of 10.18-14.07{\%}. The economic benefit from applying the liquid fertilizer to sugarcane was found significant.},
