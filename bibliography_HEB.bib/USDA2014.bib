abstract = {Nitrate (NO 3 -) is a form of inorganic nitrogen (N) naturally occurring in soils. Sources of soil NO 3 -include decomposing plant residues and animal manure/compost, chemical fertilizers, exudates from living plants, rainfall, and lightning. Eventually, nitrate ions immobilized by microorganisms (nitrate taken up by microorganisms) are converted into organic forms and released back to the soil in plant-available forms when dead soil organisms are fed upon or decompose. In well drained soils, ammonium (NH 4 +) and ammonia (NH 3) are converted into NO 3 by very specific populations of aerobic bacteria. This process is known as nitrification. Another biological N transformation is denitrification, which is the conversion of NO 3 -into nitrous oxide (N 2 O), nitrogen dioxide (NO 2), and nitrogen gas (N 2) that often occurs in anaerobic soils, such as waterlogged soils and wetlands. Even when nitrifying bacteria are very active in the outer parts of aggregates in well aerated soils, denitrification may still occur in anaerobic microsites inside the aggregates. Nitrate is very soluble in water and can be easily transported by runoff and other surface and subsurface flows to rivers and lakes or moved downward to ground water.},
