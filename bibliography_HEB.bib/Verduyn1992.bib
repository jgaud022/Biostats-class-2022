abstract = {The internal pH of Saccharomyces cere- visiae IGC 3507 III (a respiratory-deficient mu- tant) was measured by the distribution of [14C]propionic acid, when the yeast was ferment- ing glucose at pH 3.5, 4.5 and 5.5 in the presence of several concentrations of acetic acid and etha- nol. Good correlation was obtained between fer- mentation rates and internal pH. For all external pH values tested, the internal pH was 7.0-7.2 in the absence of inhibitors. The addition of acetic acid and/or ethanol resulted in a decrease of fer- mentation rate together with a drop in internal pH. Internal pH did not depend on the concentra- tion of total external acetic acid but only on the concentration of the undissociated form of the acid. Ethanol potentiated the effect of acetic acid both with respect to inhibition of fermentation and internal acidification.},
