abstract = {Background: Increased infertility in women has been reported after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) for ulcerative colitis but reported infertility rates vary substantially. Aims: (1) To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis or the relative risk of infertility post-IPAA compared with medical management; (2) to estimate the rate of infertility post-IPAA; and (3) to identify modifiable risk factors which contribute to infertility. Methods: Medline, EMBASE, Current Contents, meeting abstracts, and bibliographies were searched independently by two investigators. The titles and abstracts of 189 potentially relevant studies were reviewed; eight met the criteria and all data were extracted independently. Consensus was achieved on each data point, and fixed effects meta-analyses, a funnel plot, and sensitivity analyses were performed. Results: The initial meta-analysis of eight studies had significant heterogeneity (p = 0.004) due to one study with very high preoperative infertility (38{\%}). When this study was omitted, the relative risk of infertility after IPAA was 3.17 (2.41-4.18), with non-significant heterogeneity. The weighted average infertility rate in medically treated ulcerative colitis was 15{\%} for all seven studies, and the weighted average infertility rate was 48{\%} after IPAA (50{\%} if all eight studies are included). We were unable to identify any procedural factors that consistently affected the risk of infertility. Conclusions: IPAA increases the risk of infertility in women with ulcerative colitis by approximately threefold. Infertility, defined as achieving pregnancy in 12 months of attempting conception, increased from 15{\%} to 48{\%} in women post-IPAA for ulcerative colitis. This provides a basis for counselling patients considering colectomy with IPAA. Further studies of modifiable risk factors are needed.},
