abstract = {While the stillage waste from ethanol fuel production can be a serious source of water pollution, it can also be a valuable resource from which to recover useful products such as fertilizer, animal feed, or methane gas. Selecting the most appropriate stillage management is a matter of trade-offs between energy, economic, and environmental considerations. There is a need for an information clearing-house on commercial stillage handling processes to assist ethanol fuel developers in matching processes to their needs. {\textcopyright} 1982.},
