abstract = {Fractionation of cold-pressed lemon-peel oil into several compound types, namely hydrocarbons, alcohols and aldehydes, esters and others, was demonstrated using a semi-preparative supercritical fluid chromatographic system. By utilizing stepwise pressure and modifier programming, it was possible to load 0.5 ml (about 0.5 g) of lemon-peel oil onto 50 mm Ã— 7.2 mm I.D. column packed with silica gel (10-20 $\mu$m). The technique can be used to produce new flavours by remixing fractions in different proportions, and for simple removal of terpenes from the oil. {\textcopyright} 1990.},
