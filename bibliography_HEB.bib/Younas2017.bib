abstract = {In this study, effluents from four different fertilizer industrial units, producing different fertilizers have been analyzed for various physicochemical features. The color, odour, temperature, pH, electrical conductivity (EC), total dissolved solids (TDS), Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), chloride (Cl−), fluoride (F−), carbonate (CO32−), bicarbonate (HCO31−), ammonia (NH3), nitrate (NO3−), nitrite (NO2−), phosphate (PO43−), sulphate (SO42−), sodium (Na), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), zinc (Zn), chromium (Cr) and lead (Pb) were determined using standard analytical procedures. The values of measured parameters were found significantly (P{\textless}0.05) higher than the permissible limits recommended for wastewater. In comparison to national environmental quality standards, it was concluded that the effluents from fertilizer industries require proper treatment prior to discharge into the environment.},
