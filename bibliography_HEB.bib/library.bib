abstract = {The enzymes of the Leloir pathway catalyze the conversion of galactose to a more metabolically useful version, glucose-6-phosphate. This pathway is required as galactose itself cannot be used for glycolysis directly. In most organisms, including the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, five enzymes are required to catalyze this conversion: a galactose mutarotase, a galactokinase, a galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase, a UDP-galactose-4-epimerase, and a phosphoglucomutase. In yeast, the genes encoding these enzymes are tightly controlled at the level of transcription and are only transcribed under specific sets of conditions. In the presence of glucose, the genes encoding the Leloir pathway enzymes (often called the GAL genes) are repressed through the action of a transcriptional repressor Mig1p. In the presence of galactose, but in the absence of glucose, the concerted actions of three other proteins Gal4p, Gal80p, and Gal3p, and two small molecules (galactose and ATP) enable the rapid and high-level activation of the GAL genes. The precise molecular mechanism of the GAL genetic switch is controversial. Recent work on solving the three-dimensional structures of the various GAL enzymes proteins and the GAL transcriptional switch proteins affords a unique opportunity to delve into the precise, and potentially unambiguous, molecular mechanism of a highly exploited transcriptional circuit. Understanding the details of the transcriptional and metabolic events that occur in this pathway can be used as a paradigm for understanding the integration of metabolism and transcriptional control more generally, and will assist our understanding of fundamental biochemical processes and how these might be exploited. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Growth, substrate consumption, metabolite formation, biomass composition and respiratory parameters of Kluyveromyces marxianus ATCC 26548 were determined during aerobic batch and chemostat cultivations, using mineral medium with glucose as the sole carbon source, at 30°C and pH 5.0. Carbon balances closed within 95-101{\%} in all experiments. A maximum specific growth rate of 0.56 h-1, a biomass yield on glucose of 0.51 g g-1, and a maximum specific consumption of oxygen of 11.1 mmol g-1 h -1 were obtained during batch cultures. The concentration of excreted metabolites was very low at the culture conditions applied, representing 6{\%} of the consumed carbon at most. Acetate and pyruvate were excreted to a larger extent than ethanol under the batch conditions, and the protein content accounted for 54.6{\%} of the biomass dry weight. Steady states were obtained during chemostats at dilution rates of 0.1, 0.25 and 0.5 h-1. At the two former dilution rates, cells grew at carbon limitation and the biomass yield on glucose was similar to that obtained under the batch conditions. Metabolite formation was rather low, accounting for a total of 0.005 C-mol C-mol -1 substrate. At 0.5 h-1, although the biomass yield on glucose was similar to the value obtained under the above-mentioned conditions, the cultivation was not under carbon limitation. Under this condition, 2-oxoglutarate, acetate, pyruvate and ethanol were the prevalent metabolites excreted. Total metabolite formation only accounted to 0.056 C-mol C-mol -1 of substrate. A very high protein and a low carbohydrate content (71.9{\%} and 9.6{\%} of biomass dry weight, respectively) were measured in cells under this condition. It is concluded that K. marxianus aligns with the so-called aerobic-respiring or Crabtree-negative yeasts. Furthermore, it has one of the highest growth rates among yeasts, and a high capacity of converting sugar into biomass, even when carbon is not the limiting nutrient. These results provide useful data regarding the future application of K. marxianus in processes aimed at the production of biomass-linked compounds, with high yields and productivities. {\textcopyright} 2007 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.},

abstract = {Permafrost soils in boreal and Arctic ecosystems store almost twice as much carbon 1,2 as is currently present in the atmosphere 3 . Permafrost thaw and the microbial decomposition of previously frozen organic carbon is considered one of the most likely positive climate feedbacks from terrestrial ecosystems to the atmosphere in a warmer world 1,2,4–7 . The rate of carbon release from permafrost soils is highly uncertain, but it is crucial for predicting the strength and timing of this carbon-cycle feedback effect, and thus how important permafrost thaw will be for climate change this century and beyond 1,2,4–7 . Sustained transfers of carbon to the atmosphere that could cause a significant positive feedback to climate change must come from old carbon, which forms the bulk of the perma-frost carbon pool that accumulated over thousands of years 8–11 . Here we measure net ecosystem carbon exchange and the radio-carbon age of ecosystem respiration in a tundra landscape under-going permafrost thaw 12 to determine the influence of old carbon loss on ecosystem carbon balance. We find that areas that thawed over the past 15 years had 40 per cent more annual losses of old carbon than minimally thawed areas, but had overall net eco-system carbon uptake as increased plant growth offset these losses. In contrast, areas that thawed decades earlier lost even more old carbon, a 78 per cent increase over minimally thawed areas; this old carbon loss contributed to overall net ecosystem carbon release despite increased plant growth. Our data document signifi-cant losses of soil carbon with permafrost thaw that, over decadal timescales, overwhelms increased plant carbon uptake 13–15 at rates that could make permafrost a large biospheric carbon source in a warmer world. We measured ecosystem carbon (C) dynamics at a tundra site in Alaska where permafrost thaw has been documented since 1990, and was occurring in the area before that time, probably owing to regional climate change 12 . The Eight Mile Lake watershed is located in the northern foothills of the Alaska Range (Supplementary Information and Supplementary Fig. 1). Permafrost temperature has been monitored annually on a gentle north-facing slope in a 30-m-deep borehole that was installed in 1985 before the permafrost started to thaw 12 . Although permafrost thaw can sometimes result in water ponding, depending on local topography 16,17 , this landscape consists largely of relatively well-drained uplands (Supplementary Fig. 2). Permafrost thaw at the local level occurs as a series of positive feed-backs between temperature change, ground subsidence, and hydro-logic redistribution that causes further thawing in a spatially heterogeneous pattern generated by water flow paths. In this water-shed, we monitored three sites that represented minimal, moderate and extensive amounts of change as a result of the duration of per-mafrost thaw, based on observations of ground subsidence, depth of thaw, historical ground temperature measurements, and historical and current photographs (Supplementary Table 1) 12,18–20},

abstract = {The conversion of plant material into biofuels and high value products is a two-step process of hydrolysing plant lignocellulose and next fermenting the sugars produced. However, lignocellulosic hydrolysis not only frees sugars for fermentation it simultaneously generates toxic chemicals, including phenolic compounds which severely inhibit yeast fermentation. To understand the molecular basis of phenolic compound toxicity, we performed genome-wide chemogenomic screens in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to identify deletion mutants that were either hypersensitive or resistant to three common phenolic compounds found in plant hydrolysates: coniferyl aldehyde, ferulic acid and 4-hydroxybenzoic acid. Despite being similar in structure, our screen revealed that yeast utilizes distinct pathways to tolerate phenolic compound exposure. Furthermore, although each phenolic compound induced reactive oxygen species (ROS), ferulic acid and 4-hydroxybenzoic acid-induced a general cytoplasmic ROS distribution while coniferyl aldehyde-induced ROS partially localized to the mitochondria and to a lesser extent, the endoplasmic reticulum. We found that the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase enzyme Zwf1, which catalyzes the rate limiting step of pentose phosphate pathway, is required for reducing the accummulation of coniferyl aldehyde-induced ROS, potentially through the sequestering of Zwf1 to sites of ROS accumulation. Our novel insights into biological impact of three common phenolic inhibitors will inform the engineering of yeast strains with improved efficiency of biofuel and biochemical production in the presence hydrolysate-derived phenolic compounds.},

abstract = {Glacial ice covered the Chalk River area through most of the Wisconsin Stage. About 11 300 yr ago, an ice retreat was followed immediately by a short incursion of Champlain Sea waters, which deposited at least 2.5m of clay, silt, and sand. A local readvance, probably associated with the St. Narcisse event, deposited till on the marine sediments. Following the final retreat of the ice from the area, lacustrine and aeolian deposition occurred locally for a short time. About 10 500 yr ago, the N Bay drainage route opened, greatly increasing the discharge of the Ottawa River. A faint terrace at a present elevation of 209m probably formed at this time. Changes in the drainage routes of proglacial lakes and in the rate of ice retreat caused a general decrease in discharge rates, and resulted in the formation of pronounced terraces. By about 5000 yr BP, the N Bay outlet closed, and the river fell to approximately 111m, its present elevation at Chalk River. -from Authors},

abstract = {Cyanobacterial blooms are common in the Baltic Sea. They are dominated by Aphanizomenon flos-aquae and Nodularia spumigena and take place in July-August. Investigations of bloom development using different approaches have been carried out in the Gulf of Finland during recent years. The ship-of-opportunity technique allows to observe the upper layer dynamics from meso- to basin-wide scale with high temporal and spatial frequency at low cost. Unattended measurements on board a commercial ferry along a transect between Tallinn and Helsinki have been conducted for 3 years (1997-1999). The influence of weather conditions - temperature and wind - on the cyanobacterial bloom development was investigated. The formation of cyanobacterial blooms was favoured by warm and calm weather, while in cold and windy conditions other species formed mass occurrences. Water temperature has been found to be the main factor controlling the initiation of the bloom, in general, while vertical stratification appeared to be the critical factor determining the intensity of the bloom at species level. The spatial distribution of the cyanobacterial bloom was determined rather by the wind-forced advection than by the possible vertical transport of nutrients in the areas of the observed upwelling events. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

Here we use field data from the 2011 National Wetland Condition Assessment to provide unbiased estimates of soil carbon stocks for wetlands at regional and national scales. We find that wetlands in the conterminous United States store a total of 11.52 PgC, much of which is within soils deeper than 30 cm. Freshwater inland wetlands, in part due to their substantial areal extent, hold nearly ten-fold more carbon than tidal saltwater sites-indicating their importance in regional carbon storage. Our data suggest a possible relationship between carbon stocks and anthropogenic disturbance. These data highlight the need to protect wetlands to mitigate the risk of avoidable contributions to climate change.},

abstract = {Strains belonging to the yeast species Kluyveromyces marxianus have been isolated from a great variety of habitats, which results in a high metabolic diversity and a substantial degree of intraspecific polymorphism. As a consequence, several different biotechnological applications have been investigated with this yeast: production of enzymes ($\beta$-galactosidase, $\beta$-glucosidase, inulinase, and polygalacturonases, among others), of single-cell protein, of aroma compounds, and of ethanol (including high-temperature and simultaneous saccharification-fermentation processes); reduction of lactose content in food products; production of bioingredients from cheese-whey; bioremediation; as an anticholesterolemic agent; and as a host for heterologous protein production. Compared to its congener and model organism, Kluyveromyces lactis, the accumulated knowledge on K. marxianus is much smaller and spread over a number of different strains. Although there is no publicly available genome sequence for this species, 20{\%} of the CBS 712 strain genome was randomly sequenced (Llorente et al. in FEBS Lett 487:71-75, 2000). In spite of these facts, K. marxianus can envisage a great biotechnological future because of some of its qualities, such as a broad substrate spectrum, thermotolerance, high growth rates, and less tendency to ferment when exposed to sugar excess, when compared to K. lactis. To increase our knowledge on the biology of this species and to enable the potential applications to be converted into industrial practice, a more systematic approach, including the careful choice of (a) reference strain(s) by the scientific community, would certainly be of great value. {\textcopyright} 2008 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Biofuel alcohols have severe consequences on the microbial hosts used in their biosynthesis, which limits the productivity of the bioconversion. The cell envelope is one of the most strongly affected structures, in particular, as the external concentration of biofuels rises during biosynthesis. Damage to the cell envelope can have severe consequences, such as impairment of transport into and out of the cell; however, the nature of butanol-induced envelope damage has not been well characterized. In the present study, the effects of n-butanol on the cell envelope of Escherichia coli were investigated. Using enzyme and fluorescence-based assays, we observed that 1 {\%} v/v n-butanol resulted in the release of lipopolysaccharides from the outer membrane of E. coli and caused ‘leakiness' in both outer and inner membranes. Higher concentrations of n-butanol, within the range of 2–10 {\%} (v/v), resulted in inner membrane protrusion through the peptidoglycan observed by characteristic blebs. The findings suggest that strategies for rational engineering of butanol-tolerant bacterial strains should take into account all components of the cell envelope.},

abstract = {Mercury (Hg) undergoes systematic stable isotopic fractionation; therefore, isotopic signatures of Hg may provide a new tool to track sources, sinks, and dominant chemical transformation pathways of Hg in the environment. We investigated the isotopic fractionation of Hg by Hg(II) resistant (Hg R) bacteria expressing the mercuric reductase (MerA) enzyme. The isotopic composition of both the reactant Hg(II) added to the growth medium and volatilized product (Hg(0)) was measured using cold vapor generation and multiple collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. We found that exponentially dividing pure cultures of a gram negative strain Escherichia coli JM109/pPB117 grown with abundant electron donor and high Hg(II) concentrations at 37, 30, and 22 °C, and a natural microbial consortium incubated in natural site water at 30 °C after enrichment of HgR microbes, preferentially reduced the lighter isotopes of Hg. In all cases, Hg underwent Rayleigh fractionation with the best estimates of $\alpha$202/198 values ranging from 1.0013 to 1.0020. In the cultures grown at 37 °C, below a certain threshold Hg(II) concentration, the extent of fractionation decreased progressively. This study demonstrates mass-dependent kinetic fractionation of Hg and could lead to development of a new stable isotopic approach to the study of Hg biogeochemical cycling in the environment. {\textcopyright} 2007 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Forest fires in permafrost areas often modify ground surface conditions, causing deepening of the active layer and thawing of near-surface permafrost. Takhini River valley lies in the discontinuous permafrost zone of southern Yukon Territory. The valley floor is covered by glaciolacustrine deposits, which are locally ice rich. In 1958 extensive forest fires burned most of the vegetation and the soil organic horizon in the valley, but 50 km west of Whitehorse, 1 km2 of spruce forest adjacent to the Alaska Highway escaped burning. Permafrost beneath this stand of trees is in equilibrium with surface conditions: the acive layer is 1.4 m thick, the base of permafrost is at 18.5 m, the annual mean temperature at the top of permafrost (1.5 m) is -0.8°C, and the temperature gradient in permafrost is constant with depth. At burned sites nearby there has been little regeneration of forest vegetation since the fire, and long-term permafrost degradation has occurred. At one burned site, the permafrost table is more than 3.75 m below the ground surface, the mean annual ground temperature is -0.2°C or warmer throughout the profile, the annual mean temperature at 1.5 m is 0.1°C, and permafrost is thawing from top and bottom. A simplified analytical model for thawing of permafrost indicates that over a millennium will be required to degrade permafrost completely at this site, if thawing proceeds from the top down. The result demonstrates the persistence of ice-rich permafrost a few metres below the ground surface, even at sites near the southern margin of permafrost in Canada.},

abstract = {Flocculating yeasts are highly useful in fermentation processes because these cells can be separated easily from the fermentation mash. However, native yeasts are usually non-flocculating, including Kluyveromyces marxianus, which exhibits a potent high-temperature ethanol fermentation ability. We describe here the construction of flocculent K. marxianus strains via the introduction of the FLO1, FLO5, FLO9, and FLO10 genes from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The S. cerevisiae FLO genes were overexpressed by upstream insertion of the constitutive TDH3 promoter, resulting in flocculent S. cerevisiae strains. These TDH3p-FLO sequences were then amplified by PCR and introduced directly into a K. marxianus strain. These K. marxianus strains showed a flocculation phenotype, indicating that the introduced S. cerevisiae TDH3 promoter and all FLO genes were functional in this strain. Moreover, a flocculating K. marxianus strain showed the same ethanol production profile as that of its wild-type parent. The K. marxianus flocculating strains we generated should be useful in the future development of cost-effective fed-batch and continuous fermentation systems at high temperatures.},

abstract = {The psychosocial consequences of disasters have been studied for more than 100years. The most common mental health consequences are depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, medically unexplained somatic symptoms, and stigma. The excess morbidity rate of psychiatric disorders in the first year after a disaster is in the order of 20{\%}. Disasters involving radiation are particularly pernicious because the exposure is invisible and universally dreaded, and can pose a long-term threat to health. After the Chernobyl disaster, studies of clean-up workers (liquidators) and adults from contaminated areas found a two-fold increase in post-traumatic stress and other mood and anxiety disorders and significantly poorer subjective ratings of health. Among liquidators, the most important risk factor was severity of exposure. In general population samples, the major risk factor was perceived exposure to harmful levels of radiation. These findings are consistent with results from A-bomb survivors and populations studied after the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant accident. With regard to children, apart from findings from ecological studies that lack direct data on radiation or other teratologic exposures and local studies in Kiev, the epidemiologic evidence suggests that neither radiation exposure nor the stress of growing up in the shadow of the accident was associated with emotional disorders, cognitive dysfunction, or impaired academic performance. Thus, based on the studies of adults, the Chernobyl Forum concluded that mental health was the largest public health problem unleashed by the accident. Since mental health is a leading cause of disability, physical morbidity, and mortality, health monitoring after radiation accidents like Fukushima should include standard measures of well-being. Moreover, given the comorbidity of mental and physical health, the findings support the value of training non-psychiatrist physicians in recognizing and treating common mental health problems like depression in Fukushima patients. {\textcopyright} 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Although ulcerative colitis commonly affects young females, the impact of ulcerative colitis and its treatment on female fertility have not been well studied. The purpose of this survey was to examine the impact of ulcerative colitis and ileal pouch-anal anastomosis on female reproductive ability. METHODS: Demographic, reproductive history, and disease history information were obtained via a questionnaire mailed to females who had pelvic pouch surgery or nonoperative management for ulcerative colitis. Based on age at diagnosis, age at surgery, and marital status, 153 females who had pelvic pouch surgery and 60 females who had nonoperative management for ulcerative colitis were identified for inclusion. Patients were asked if they attempted to become pregnant, when relative to their diagnosis or surgery, and if they were successful. Married or cohabiting females aged 18 to 44 years who failed to become pregnant during 12 months of unprotected intercourse were defined as infertile. RESULTS: The infertility rate was significantly higher in females who had pelvic pouch surgery compared with females managed nonoperatively (59/153 (38.1 percent) vs. 8/60 (13.3 percent), respectively; P {\textless} 0.001). There was no difference in female fertility after diagnosis with ulcerative colitis compared with before diagnosis (odds ratio, 0.68; P = 0.23). In contrast, there was a 98 percent reduction in fertility after pelvic pouch surgery compared with before surgery (odds ratio, 0.021; P {\textless} 0.0001). By logistic regression, increasing age was the only factor associated with failure to become pregnant after surgery (odds ratio, 1.136 per additional year of age; P = 0.027). CONCLUSIONS: Females with ulcerative colitis who are managed nonoperatively have normal fertility, which suggests that ulcerative colitis and medical therapy do not decrease female reproductive ability. After pelvic pouch surgery for ulcerative colitis, female fertility is significantly decreased and this problem should be discussed routinely with patients considering this procedure.},

abstract = {Distillery effluents, a major by-product of distilleries are a major environmental hazard as they are rich in organic matter, micro- and macroelements. Management of this enormous amount of nutrient-rich effluent and its effective utilization is a major challenge. These effluents can be used as a source of nutrient by C4 crops like sugarcane and subsequent ratoon crops under fertigation system. Impact of fertigation in sugarcane-ratoon cropping system on soil microbial biomass is important as the microbial population plays an important role in the nutrient and biogeochemical recycling. Keeping this in mind, a field experiment was carried out in the sandy loam soil of semi-arid to humid sub-tropical climate of Gajraula (28.85°N, 78.23°E) region, India with different doses of diluted and undiluted effluent for fertigation of sugarcane crop in presence and absence of 50 {\%} recommended dose of fertilizers with suitable replicates. Two post-sown irrigations with four times diluted effluent gave the maximum yield in case of sugarcane crop. Taking into consideration the yield and the culturable microbial population sizes, it can be concluded that one to two post-sown irrigations with diluted effluent can be used to enhance soil fertility in terms of microbial population and to enhance sugarcane and ratoon crop productivity. This package is economically viable and can also take care of distillery waste management and reduction in consumption of chemical fertilizers by 50 {\%}, a key for sustainable agricultural development.},

abstract = {Nitrogen deficiencies in grape musts are one of the main causes of stuck or sluggish wine fermentations. Several putative biomarkers were tested in order to analyze their appropriateness to detect nitrogen stress in the yeast. To this aim, four commercial wine strains (PDM, ARM, RVA and TTA) were grown in a synthetic grape must with different nitrogen concentrations. Trehalose accumulation, arginase activity and the expression of eleven genes were tested in these wine strains, known to have different nitrogen requirements. The overall response of the four strains was similar, with differences in response intensity (PDM and RVA with higher intensity) and response time (which was also related with nitrogen consumption time). Trehalose response was mostly related to entry into the stationary phase, whereas arginase activity was responsive to nitrogen depletion, although its measurement is too complicated to be used for routine monitoring during winemaking. The expression of the genes DAL4, DAL5, DUR3 and GAP1 was clearly related to nitrogen depletion and thus, GAP1 and DAL4 were selected as markers of nitrogen deficiency. In order to adapt expression analysis to winemaking conditions, the original strains were transformed into reporter strains based on the expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP) under control of the promoters for GAP1 and DAL4. The transformants had a similar fermentative capacity to the parental strains and were able to detect alterations in yeast physiological status due to nitrogen limitations. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Following the Fukushima accident, the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) convened a task group to compile lessons learned from the nuclear reactor accident at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in Japan, with respect to the ICRP system of radiological protection. In this memorandum the members of the task group express their personal views on issues arising during and after the accident, without explicit endorsement of or approval by the ICRP. While the affected people were largely protected against radiation exposure and no one incurred a lethal dose of radiation (or a dose sufficiently large to cause radiation sickness), many radiological protection questions were raised. The following issues were identified: inferring radiation risks (and the misunderstanding of nominal risk coefficients); attributing radiation effects from low dose exposures; quantifying radiation exposure; assessing the importance of internal exposures; managing emergency crises; protecting rescuers and volunteers; responding with medical aid; justifying necessary but disruptive protective actions; transiting from an emergency to an existing situation; rehabilitating evacuated areas; restricting individual doses of members of the public; caring for infants and children; categorising public exposures due to an accident; considering pregnant women and their foetuses and embryos; monitoring public protection; dealing with 'contamination' of territories, rubble and residues and consumer products; recognising the importance of psychological consequences; and fostering the sharing of information. Relevant ICRP Recommendations were scrutinised, lessons were collected and suggestions were compiled. It was concluded that the radiological protection community has an ethical duty to learn from the lessons of Fukushima and resolve any identified challenges. Before another large accident occurs, it should be ensured that inter alia: radiation risk coefficients of potential health effects are properly interpreted; the limitations of epidemiological studies for attributing radiation effects following low exposures are understood; any confusion on protection quantities and units is resolved; the potential hazard from the intake of radionuclides into the body is elucidated; rescuers and volunteers are protected with an ad hoc system; clear recommendations on crisis management and medical care and on recovery and rehabilitation are available; recommendations on public protection levels (including infant, children and pregnant women and their expected offspring) and associated issues are consistent and understandable; updated recommendations on public monitoring policy are available; acceptable (or tolerable) 'contamination' levels are clearly stated and defined; strategies for mitigating the serious psychological consequences arising from radiological accidents are sought; and, last but not least, failures in fostering information sharing on radiological protection policy after an accident need to be addressed with recommendations to minimise such lapses in communication.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The cellular retinol binding protein I gene (CRBP) is downregulated in a subset of human breast cancers and in MMTV-Myc induced mouse mammary tumors. Functional studies suggest that CRBP downregulation contributes to breast tumor progression. What is the mechanism underlying CRBP downregulation in cancer? Here we investigated the hypothesis that CRBP is epigenetically silenced through DNA hypermethylation in human and mouse breast cancer. RESULTS: Bisulfite sequencing of CRBP in a panel of 6 human breast cancer cell lines demonstrated that, as a rule, CRBP hypermethylation is closely and inversely related to CRBP expression and identified one exception to this rule. Treatment with 5-azacytidine, a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, led to CRBP reexpression, supporting the hypothesis that CRBP hypermethylation is a proximal cause of CRBP silencing. In some cells CRBP reexpression was potentiated by co-treatment with retinoic acid, an inducer of CRBP, and trichostatin A, a histone deacetylase inhibitor. Southern blot analysis of a small panel of human breast cancer specimens identified one case characterized by extensive CRBP hypermethylation, in association with undetectable CRBP mRNA and protein. Bisulfite sequencing of CRBP in MMTV-Myc and MMTV-Neu/NT mammary tumor cell lines extended the rule of CRBP hypermethylation and silencing (both seen in MMTV-Myc but not MMTV-Neu/NT cells) from human to mouse breast cancer and suggested that CRBP hypermethylation is an oncogene-specific event. CONCLUSION: CRBP hypermethylation appears to be an evolutionarily conserved and principal mechanism of CRBP silencing in breast cancer. Based on the analysis of transgenic mouse mammary tumor cells, we hypothesize that CRBP silencing in human breast cancer may be associated with a specific oncogenic signature},

abstract = {Background: High-temperature fermentation technology with thermotolerant microbes has been expected to reduce the cost of bioconversion of cellulosic biomass to fuels or chemicals. Thermotolerant Kluyveromyces marxianus possesses intrinsic abilities to ferment and assimilate a wide variety of substrates including xylose and to efficiently produce proteins. These capabilities have been found to exceed those of the traditional ethanol producer Saccharomyces cerevisiae or lignocellulose-bioconvertible ethanologenic Scheffersomyces stipitis. Results: The complete genome sequence of K. marxianus DMKU 3-1042 as one of the most thermotolerant strains in the same species has been determined. A comparison of its genomic information with those of other yeasts and transcriptome analysis revealed that the yeast bears beneficial properties of temperature resistance, wide-range bioconversion ability, and production of recombinant proteins. The transcriptome analysis clarified distinctive metabolic pathways under three different growth conditions, static culture, high temperature, and xylose medium, in comparison to the control condition of glucose medium under a shaking condition at 30°C. Interestingly, the yeast appears to overcome the issue of reactive oxygen species, which tend to accumulate under all three conditions. Conclusions: This study reveals many gene resources for the ability to assimilate various sugars in addition to species-specific genes in K. marxianus, and the molecular basis of its attractive traits for industrial applications including high-temperature fermentation. Especially, the thermotolerance trait may be achieved by an integrated mechanism consisting of various strategies. Gene resources and transcriptome data of the yeast are particularly useful for fundamental and applied researches for innovative applications.},

Good correlation was obtained between fer- mentation rates and internal pH. For all external pH values tested, the internal pH was 7.0-7.2 in the absence of inhibitors. The addition of acetic acid and/or ethanol resulted in a decrease of fer- mentation rate together with a drop in internal pH. Internal pH did not depend on the concentra- tion of total external acetic acid but only on the concentration of the undissociated form of the acid. Ethanol potentiated the effect of acetic acid both with respect to inhibition of fermentation and internal acidification.},

abstract = {The relative importance of gross chromosomal rearrangements to adaptive evolution has not been precisely defined. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae flor yeast strains offer significant advantages for the study of molecular evolution since they have recently evolved to a high degree of specialization in a very restrictive environment. Using DNA microarray technology, we have compared the genomes of two prominent variants of S. cerevisiae flor yeast strains. The strains differ from one another in the DNA copy number of 116 genomic regions that comprise 38{\%} of the genome. In most cases, these regions are amplicons flanked by repeated sequences or other recombination hotspots previously described as regions where double-strand breaks occur. The presence of genes that confer specific characteristics to the flor yeast within the amplicons supports the role of chromosomal rearrangements as a major mechanism of adaptive evolution in S. cerevisiae. We propose that nonallelic interactions are enhanced by ethanol- and acetaldehyde-induced double-strand breaks in the chromosomal DNA, which are repaired by pathways that yield gross chromosomal rearrangements. This mechanism of chromosomal evolution could also account for the sexual isolation shown among the flor yeast.},

abstract = {We here report biomagnification (the increasing accumulation of bioactive, often deleterious molecules through higher trophic levels of a food chain) of the neurotoxic nonprotein amino acid beta-methylamino-l-alanine (BMAA) in the Guam ecosystem. Free-living cyanobacteria produce 0.3 microg/g BMAA, but produce 2-37 microg/g as symbionts in the coralloid roots of cycad trees. BMAA is concentrated in the developing reproductive tissues of the cycad Cycas micronesica, averaging 9 microg/g in the fleshy seed sarcotesta and a mean of 1,161 microg/g BMAA in the outermost seed layer. Flying foxes (Pteropus mariannus), which forage on the seeds, accumulate a mean of 3,556 microg/g BMAA. Flying foxes are a prized food item of the indigenous Chamorro people who boil them in coconut cream and eat them whole. Chamorros who die of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/parkinsonism-dementia complex (AL-SPDC), a neurodegenerative disease with symptoms similar to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease, have an average of 6.6 microg/g BMAA in their brain tissues. The biomagnification of BMAA through the Guam ecosystem fits a classic triangle of increasing concentrations of toxic compounds up the food chain. This may explain why the incidence of ALS-PDC among the Chamorro was 50-100 times the incidence of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis elsewhere. Biomagnification of cyanobacterial BMAA may not be unique to Guam; our discovery of BMAA in the brain tissue from Alzheimer's patients from Canada suggests alternative ecological pathways for the bioaccumulation of BMAA in aquatic or terrestrial ecosystems.},

abstract = {Individual zooxanthellate corals vary in their susceptibility to bleaching, caused by the loss of symbiotic algae in response to increased temperatures and solar radiation. In 1995 at Phuket, Thailand, the west face of colonies of the massive coral Goniastrea aspera displayed bleaching in January-March, mediated by high solar radiation. By May, when sea temperatures were anomalously high but solar radiation much reduced, the east sides preferentially bleached. Cores from the east faces of corals exposed to elevated temperature under low irradiance in a laboratory experiment also bleached in response to elevated temperature. The algae in G. aspera were Symbiodinium sp., and the rDNA (both ssu and ITS regions) sequences did not differ between the east and west faces, indicating that the bleaching responses cannot be attributed to genetic factors in the symbiotic algae of the type described in other coral species. It is concluded that, in this system, bleaching is shaped by experience, and that the algae may acquire cross-protection against bleaching from solar to temperature stresses. The impact of experience on bleaching susceptibility may become increasingly important in shaping coral responses to temperature and solar radiation stresses in the coming decades.},

abstract = {It is now more than six months since the beginning of the accident on 11 March 2011 at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant in Japan. The Japanese government and local health authorities have started to collect the information necessary to estimate radiation doses received by those living in the area around the plant, drafted plans for the health care of residents, and started to implement some of them. This paper reviews and discusses the studies necessary for risk evaluation of cancer and non-cancer diseases, including those already planned, mainly from the view point of evaluating health risk using epidemiological approaches. In the long run, it is important to establish a cohort with a control group. Even if the cumulative doses are estimated to be so low that it is difficult to evaluate the risk of cancer and non-cancer diseases, it is necessary to conduct such a study to reassure residents. The health care programme of the Fukushima Prefecture government, including health check-ups of residents, will help to assess indirect effects of radiation exposure, including psychological problems. The success of any studies of radiation epidemiology depends on the collection of accurate information on radiation doses received by the study subjects. However, some of the dosimetry surveys were not conducted in a timely manner. (It should be recognised, though, that such a problem might have been inevitable, considering the chaotic condition after the nuclear accident.) Accurate estimation of the radiation dose received by each resident is not only important for scientific risk evaluation but also to inform each resident about his or her potential risk. Otherwise, residents will bear an undue psychological burden from uncertainties regarding their radiation exposure and its health consequences. One of other important tasks in Fukushima is the improvement of the quality of the regional cancer registry in this prefecture. It is also important to start thyroid cancer screening in a year or two since the expected minimum latent period among those exposed in early childhood is about 4years. Recently, local health authorities decided to start a thyroid screening programme for those aged 18 years or younger. Any scientific efforts in Fukushima, which need to gain the trust of study subjects about the objectivity of research, may suffer from the fact that residents in Fukushima Prefecture have begun to suspect that the Japanese government and local authorities are keeping important information from them. It seems necessary to make more effort to reflect the opinions of residents when planning health care programmes and to gain the understanding of the public for the programme. In summary, there are many problems that make the evaluation of cancer and non-cancer disease risk in Fukushima difficult. The help of international colleagues will be invaluable for overcoming those problems. In this paper, these efforts are briefly summarised and some comments are made. {\textcopyright} 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Neonicotinoids are now the most widely used insecticides in the world. They act systemically, travelling through plant tissues and protecting all parts of the crop, and are widely applied as seed dressings. As neurotoxins with high toxicity to most arthropods, they provide effective pest control and have numerous uses in arable farming and horticulture. However, the prophylactic use of broad-spectrum pesticides goes against the long-established principles of integrated pest management (IPM), leading to environmental concerns. It has recently emerged that neonicotinoids can persist and accumulate in soils. They are water soluble and prone to leaching into waterways. Being systemic, they are found in nectar and pollen of treated crops. Reported levels in soils, waterways, field margin plants and floral resources overlap substantially with concentrations that are sufficient to control pests in crops, and commonly exceed the LC50 (the concentration which kills 50{\%} of individuals) for beneficial organisms. Concentrations in nectar and pollen in crops are sufficient to impact substantially on colony reproduction in bumblebees. Although vertebrates are less susceptible than arthropods, consumption of small numbers of dressed seeds offers a route to direct mortality in birds and mammals. Synthesis and applications. Major knowledge gaps remain, but current use of neonicotinoids is likely to be impacting on a broad range of non-target taxa including pollinators and soil and aquatic invertebrates and hence threatens a range of ecosystem services.

abstract = {The Ipojuca river, a river in Northeast Brazil extending from west to east, is situated in the semiarid interior and rainy coastal zone of Pernambuco state. The river basin covers an area of 3,514 km2, with a total river length of 215 km. The water flow regime is characterized by the annual change from dry to rainy season as well as periodically occurring dry cycles. Mean flow rates vary between 2 and 35 m3 s-1. The dominant impacts on water quality of the river are domestic sewage input in the upper catchment and sugar cane cultivation and processing in the lower catchment. Long-term monitoring data used to demonstrate the impact of sewage discharge on the river's self-purification capacity indicated a severe change to the worse in the lower course. One reason is the use of stillage (wastewater from cane processing) for fertilization and irrigation (fertigation). Pathways of contamination have been identified by evaluating cultivation and processing techniques of a bio-alcohol factory with annexed sugar cane cultivation. The river's main ecological problems are water heating, acidification, increased turbidity, oxygen imbalance, and increased coliform bacteria levels. Precipitation-related wash-off and wash-out causes significant contamination within one to two days after rainfall. The increase in coliform bacteria is a consequence of secondary contamination. To determine the impact of the sugar cane industry on the river, the Brazilian bio-alcohol program must be subject to a critical evaluation. Environmentally friendly sugar cane cultivation methods need to be developed, and sugar cane factories must use waste-reducing technologies and water cycling processes in order to protect the region's water resources. {\textcopyright} 2006 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {Background: Whey permeate is a lactose-rich effluent remaining after protein extraction from milk-resulting cheese whey, an abundant dairy waste. The lactose to ethanol fermentation can complete whey valorization chain by decreasing dairy waste polluting potential, due to its nutritional load, and producing a biofuel from renewable source at the same time. Wild type and engineered microorganisms have been proposed as fermentation biocatalysts. However, they present different drawbacks (e.g., nutritional supplements requirement, high transcriptional demand of recombinant genes, precise oxygen level, and substrate inhibition) which limit the industrial attractiveness of such conversion process. In this work, we aim to engineer a new bacterial biocatalyst, specific for dairy waste fermentation. Results: We metabolically engineered eight Escherichia coli strains via a new expression plasmid with the pyruvate-to-ethanol conversion genes, and we carried out the selection of the best strain among the candidates, in terms of growth in permeate, lactose consumption and ethanol formation. We finally showed that the selected engineered microbe (W strain) is able to efficiently ferment permeate and concentrated permeate, without nutritional supplements, in pH-controlled bioreactor. In the conditions tested in this work, the selected biocatalyst could complete the fermentation of permeate and concentrated permeate in about 50 and 85 h on average, producing up to 17 and 40 g/l of ethanol, respectively. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first report showing efficient ethanol production from the lactose contained in whey permeate with engineered E. coli. The selected strain is amenable to further metabolic optimization and represents an advance towards efficient biofuel production from industrial waste stream.},

abstract = {Methylmercury has been thought to be produced predominantly by sulfate-reducing bacteria in anoxic sediments. Here we show that in circumneutral pH sediments (Clear Lake, CA) application of a specific inhibitor of sulfate-reducing bacteria at appropriate concentrations typically inhibited less than one-half of all anaerobic methylation of added divalent mercury. This suggests that one or more additional groups of microbes are active methylators in these sediments impacted by a nearby abandoned mercury mine. From Clear Lake sediments, we isolated the iron-reducing bacterium Geobacter sp. strain CLFeRB, which can methylate mercury at a rate comparable to Desulfobulbus propionicus strata 1pr3, a sulfate-reducing bacterium known to be an active methylator. This is the first time that an iron-reducing bacterium has been shown to methylate mercury at environmentally significant rates. We suggest that mercury methylation by iron-reducing bacteria represents a previously unidentified and potentially significant source of this environmental toxin in iron-rich freshwater sediments.

abstract = {Ocean acidification represents a key threat to coral reefs by reducing the calcification rate of framework builders. In addition, acidification is likely to affect the relationship between corals and their symbiotic dinoflagellates and the productivity of this association. However, little is known about how acidification impacts on the physiology of reef builders and how acidification interacts with warming. Here, we report on an 8-week study that compared bleaching, productivity, and calcification responses of crustose coralline algae (CCA) and branching (Acropora) and massive (Porites) coral species in response to acidification and warming. Using a 30-tank experimental system, we manipulated CO(2) levels to simulate doubling and three- to fourfold increases [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projection categories IV and VI] relative to present-day levels under cool and warm scenarios. Results indicated that high CO(2) is a bleaching agent for corals and CCA under high irradiance, acting synergistically with warming to lower thermal bleaching thresholds. We propose that CO(2) induces bleaching via its impact on photoprotective mechanisms of the photosystems. Overall, acidification impacted more strongly on bleaching and productivity than on calcification. Interestingly, the intermediate, warm CO(2) scenario led to a 30{\%} increase in productivity in Acropora, whereas high CO(2) lead to zero productivity in both corals. CCA were most sensitive to acidification, with high CO(2) leading to negative productivity and high rates of net dissolution. Our findings suggest that sensitive reef-building species such as CCA may be pushed beyond their thresholds for growth and survival within the next few decades whereas corals will show delayed and mixed responses.},

abstract = {Large amounts of soil carbon deposited in permafrost may be released due to deeper seasonal thawing under the climatic conditions projected for the future. An increase in the volume of the available organic material together with the higher ground temperatures may lead to enhanced emission of greenhouse gasses. Particular concerns are associated with methane, which has a much stronger greenhouse effect than an equal amount of CO 2 . Production of methane is favored in the wetlands, which occupy up to 0.7 million km 2 in Russian permafrost regions and have accumulated about 50 Gt of carbon (Gt C). We used the permafrost model and several climatic scenarios to construct projections of the soil temperature and the depth of seasonal thawing. To evaluate the effect of such changes on the volume of the seasonally thawing organic material, we overlaid the permafrost projections on the digitized geographically referenced contours of 59 846 wetlands in the Russian Arctic. Results for the mid-21st century climate indicated up to 50{\%} increase in the volume of organic substrate in the northernmost locations along the Arctic coast and in East Siberia, where wetlands are sparse, and a relatively small increase by 10{\%}–15{\%} in West Siberia, where wetlands occupy 50{\%}–80{\%} of the land. We developed a soil carbon model and used it to estimate the changes in the methane fluxes due to higher soil temperature and increased substrate availability. According to our results, by mid-21st century the annual net flux of methane from Russian permafrost regions may increase by 6–8 Mt, depending on climatic scenario. If other sinks and sources of methane remain unchanged, this may increase the overall content of methane in the atmosphere by approximately 100 Mt, or 0.04 ppm, and lead to 0.012 • C global temperature rise.},

abstract = {The introduction of invasive bivalves such as the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) can have profound effects on aquatic ecosystems, including decreases in phytoplankton biomass and changes in the taxonomic composition of phytoplankton. Zebra mussel introductions have been associated with increased dominance of cyanobacteria, especially Microeystis, but this change may depend on interacting physical, chemical, or biotic conditions. We used a 12-yr record in the Hudson River to explore the relationship between phytoplankton composition and zebra mussel filtration. During this period (1993-2005), the mean July-September filtration rate of the zebra mussel (ZMF) varied by 8-fold, and the mean biovolume of cyanobacteria, which was dominated by Microcystis, varied from 0 to 4.2 mm(3) l(-1) and comprised up to 52{\%} of total phytoplankton biovolume. There was a tendency for high cyanobacterial biomass to be associated with low rather than high ZMF. Neither the absolute nor the relative amounts of either total cyanobacteria or Microeystis were significantly correlated to ZMF alone or in combination with total phosphorus or any other physical or chemical parameters that we measured. Cyanobacterial dominance and abundance were both strongly correlated to temperature, and over 80{\%} of the among year variance in cyanobacterial dominance could be explained by temperature in a linear model. Temperature in combination with dissolved SiO3 explained 90{\%} of the variation in cyanobacterial dominance. At higher temperatures and lower dissolved SiO3, cyanobacterial abundance increased at the expense of diatoms that dominated at lower temperatures and in higher SiO3 years. The high explanatory value of temperature is surprising as the variation in temperature among years was relatively low (24.0-26.8 degrees C). The results suggest that even slightly increased temperatures could lead to higher biomass and dominance of cyanobacteria in some aquatic systems.},

Sustainable growth was not observed under anaerobic conditions, even in the presence of unsaturated fatty acid and sterol. A maximum ethanol concentration of 40 g L-1 was produced at 45°C, with an initial specific ethanol production rate of 1.7 g g-1 h-1. This was observed at ethanol concentrations below 8 g L-1 and under oxygen-limited conditions. The low ethanol tolerance and low growth under oxygen-limited conditions required for ethanol production implied that a simple continuous process was not feasible with this yeast strain. Improved productivity was achieved through recycling biomass into the fermenter, indicating that utilising an effective cell retention method such as cell recycle or immobilisation, could lead to the development of a viable industrial process using this novel yeast strain.},

Much of the public and scientific discussion of changes in western United States wildfire has focused instead on the effects of 19th- and 20th-century land-use history. We compiled a comprehensive database of large wildfires in western United States forests since 1970 and compared it with hydroclimatic and land-surface data. Here, we show that large wildfire activity increased suddenly and markedly in the mid-1980s, with higher large-wildfire frequency, longer wildfire durations, and longer wildfire seasons. The greatest increases occurred in mid-elevation, Northern Rockies forests, where land-use histories have relatively little effect on fire risks and are strongly associated with increased spring and summer temperatures and an earlier spring snowmelt.},

BCFs for MeHg in low-DOC lake water were significantly larger than those in mixtures of lake water and high-DOC river water. The BCF for MeHg in rainwater (lowest DOC) was the largest of any treatment. Rainwater and lake water also had larger BCFs for Hg(II) than river water. Moreover, in freshwater collected from several US and Canadian field sites, BCFs for Hg(II) and MeHg were low when DOC concentrations were {\textgreater}5 mg L-1. These results suggest high concentrations of DOC inhibit bioavailability, while low concentrations may provide optimal conditions for algal uptake of Hg. However, variability of BCFs at low DOC indicates that DOC composition or other ligands may determine site-specific bioavailability of Hg.},

abstract = {Ecotoxicological risk assessment of contaminants often is based on toxicity tests with continuous-exposure profiles. However, input of many contaminants (e.g., insecticides) to surface waters typically occurs in pulses rather than continuously. Neonicotinoids are a new group of insecticides, and little is known about their toxicity to nontarget freshwater organisms and potential effects on freshwater ecosystems. The aim of the present research was to assess effects of short-term (24-h) exposure to the neonicotinoid insecticide thiacloprid, including a postexposure observation period. A comparison of several freshwater insect and crustacean species showed an increase of sensitivity by three orders of magnitude in the following order: Daphnia magna {\textless} Asellus aquaticus = Gammarus pulex {\textless} Simpetrum striolatum {\textless} Culex pipiens = Notidobia ciliaris = Simulium latigonium, with median lethal concentrations (LC50s) of 4,400, 153, 190, 31.2, 6.78, 5.47, and 5.76 $\mu$g/L, respectively (postexposure observation 11-30 d). Thiacloprid caused delayed lethal and sublethal effects, which were observed after 4 to 12 d following exposure. Reduction in LC50s found when postexposure observation was extended from 1 d to a longer period (11-30 d) was up to {\textgreater}50-fold. Hence, delayed effects occurring after short-term exposure should be considered in risk assessment. The 5{\%} hazardous concentration (HC5) of thiacloprid obtained in the present study (0.72 $\mu$g/L) is more than one order of magnitude below the currently predicted worst-case environmental concentrations in surface water. Concerning the selection of test organisms, we observed that the widely employed test organism D. magna is least sensitive among the arthropods tested and that, for neonicotinoid insecticides, an insect like the mosquito C. pipiens would be more suitable for predicting effects on sensitive species. {\textcopyright} 2008 SETAC.},

abstract = {Cheese whey, the main dairy by-product, is increasingly recognized as a source of many bioactive valuable compounds. Nevertheless, the most abundant component in whey is lactose (ca. 5{\%} w/v), which represents a significant environmental problem. Due to the large lactose surplus generated, its conversion to bio-ethanol has long been considered as a possible solution for whey bioremediation. In this review, fermentation of lactose to ethanol is discussed, focusing on wild lactose-fermenting yeasts, particularly Kluyveromyces marxianus, and recombinant Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains. The early efforts in the screening and characterization of the fermentation properties of wild lactose-consuming yeasts are reviewed. Furthermore, emphasis is given on the latter advances in engineering S. cerevisiae strains for efficient whey-to-ethanol bioprocesses. Examples of industrial implementation are briefly discussed, illustrating the viability of whey-to-ethanol systems. Current developments on strain engineering together with the growing market for biofuels will likely boost the industrial interest in such processes. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The yeast Kluyveromyces marxianus has been pointed out as a promising microorganism for a variety of industrial bioprocesses. Although genetic tools have been developed for this yeast and different potential applications have been investigated, quantitative physiological studies have rarely been reported. Here, we report and discuss the growth, substrate consumption, metabolite formation, and respiratory parameters of K. marxianus CBS 6556 during aerobic batch bioreactor cultivations, using a defined medium with different sugars as sole carbon and energy source, at 30 and 37 °C. Cultivations were carried out both on single sugars and on binary sugar mixtures. Carbon balances closed within 95 to 101 {\%} in all experiments. Biomass and CO2 were the main products of cell metabolism, whereas by-products were always present in very low proportion ({\textless}3 {\%} of the carbon consumed), as long as full aerobiosis was guaranteed. On all sugars tested as sole carbon and energy source (glucose, fructose, sucrose, lactose, and galactose), the maximum specific growth rate remained between 0.39 and 0.49 h-1, except for galactose at 37 °C, which only supported growth at 0.31 h-1. Different growth behaviors were observed on the binary sugar mixtures investigated (glucose and lactose, glucose and galactose, lactose and galactose, glucose and fructose, galactose and fructose, fructose and lactose), and the observations were in agreement with previously published data on the sugar transport systems in K. marxianus. We conclude that K. marxianus CBS 6556 does not present any special nutritional requirements; grows well in the range of 30 to 37 °C on different sugars; is capable of growing on sugar mixtures in a shorter period of time than Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which is interesting from an industrial point of view; and deviates tiny amounts of carbon towards metabolite formation, as long as full aerobiosis is maintained. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

However, SW concentrations of {\textgreater} 5{\%} showed inhibitory effects for all growth, physiological, and yield components. Accumulation of PTEs showed increasing trend with rise in SW concentration. However, under 5{\%} SW concentration, all the PTEs in rice grain and straw were within the permissible limits (PLs) recommended by FAO/WHO and no health hazards were detected by health risk assessment.

abstract = {Agricultural landscapes, including paddies, play an important role in maintaining biodiversity, but this biodiversity has been under the threat of toxic agro-chemicals. Our knowledge about how aquatic communities react to, and recover from, pesticides, particularly in relation to their residues, is deficient, despite the importance of such information for realistic environmental impact assessment of pesticides. The cumulative ecological impacts on aquatic paddy communities and their recovery processes after two successive annual applications of two systemic insecticides, imidacloprid and fipronil, were monitored between mid-May and mid-September each year. The abundance of benthic organisms during both years was significantly lower in both insecticide-treated fields than in the controls. Large-impacts of fipronil on aquatic arthropods were found after the two years. Growth of medaka fish, both adults and their juveniles, was affected by the application of the two insecticides. A Principal Response Curve analysis (PRC) showed the escalation and prolongation of changes in aquatic community composition by the successive annual treatments of each insecticide over two years. Residues of fipronil in soil, which are more persistent than those of imidacloprid, had a high level of impact on aquatic communities over time. For some taxonomic groups, particularly for water surface-dwelling and water-borne arthropods, the second annual treatment had far greater impacts than the initial treatment, indicating that impacts of these insecticides under normal use patterns cannot be accurately assessed during short-term monitoring studies, i.e., lasting less than one year. It is concluded that realistic prediction and assessment of pesticide effects at the community level should also include the long-term ecological risks of their residues whenever these persist in paddies over a year. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {We constructed a new model to study the sensitivity of permafrost carbon stocks to future climate warming. The one-dimensional model solves an equation for diffusion of heat penetrating from the overlying atmosphere and takes into account additional in situ heat production by active soil microorganisms. Decomposition of frozen soil organic matter and produced CO2 and methane fluxes result from an interplay of soil heat conduction and phase transitions, respiration, methanogenesis and methanotrophy processes. Respiration and methanotrophy consume soil oxygen and thus can only develop in an aerated top-soil column. In contrast, methanogenesis is not limited by oxygen and can be sustained within the deep soil, releasing sufficient heat to further thaw in depth the frozen carbon-rich soil organic matter. Heat production that accompanies decomposition and methanotrophy can be an essential process providing positive feedback to atmospheric warming through self-sustaining transformation of initially frozen soil carbon into CO2 and CH4. This supplementary heat becomes crucial, however, only under certain climate conditions. Oxygen limitation to soil respiration slows down the process, so that the mean flux of carbon released during the phase of intense decomposition is more than two times less than without oxygen limitation. Taking into account methanogenesis increases the mean carbon flux by 20{\%}. Part II of this study deals with mobilization of frozen carbon stock in transient climate change scenarios with more elaborated methane module, which makes it possible to consider more general cases with various site configurations. Part I (this manuscript) studies mobilization of 400 GtC carbon stock of the Yedoma in response to a stepwise rapid warming focusing on the role of supplementary heat that is released to the soil during decomposition of organic matter.},

abstract = {Background: Sustainable and economically feasible ways to produce ethanol or other liquid fuels are becoming increasingly relevant due to the limited supply of fossil fuels and the environmental consequences associated with their consumption. Microbial production of fuel compounds has gained a lot of attention and focus has mostly been on developing bio-processes involving non-food plant biomass feedstocks. The high cost of the enzymes needed to degrade such feedstocks into its constituent sugars as well as problems due to various inhibitors generated in pretreatment are two challenges that have to be addressed if cost-effective processes are to be established. Various industries, especially within the food sector, often have waste streams rich in carbohydrates and/or other nutrients, and these could serve as alternative feedstocks for such bio-processes. The dairy industry is a good example, where large amounts of cheese whey or various processed forms thereof are generated. Because of their nutrient-rich nature, these substrates are particularly well suited as feedstocks for microbial production. Results: We have generated a Lactococcus lactis strain which produces ethanol as its sole fermentation product from the lactose contained in residual whey permeate (RWP), by introducing lactose catabolism into a L. Lactis strain CS4435 (MG1363 $\Delta$3 ldh, $\Delta$pta, $\Delta$adhE, pCS4268), where the carbon flow has been directed toward ethanol instead of lactate. To achieve growth and ethanol production on RWP, we added corn steep liquor hydrolysate (CSLH) as the nitrogen source. The outcome was efficient ethanol production with a titer of 41 g/L and a yield of 70 {\%} of the theoretical maximum using a fed-batch strategy. The combination of a low-cost medium from industrial waste streams and an efficient cell factory should make the developed process industrially interesting. Conclusions: A process for the production of ethanol using L. Lactis and a cheap renewable feedstock was developed. The results demonstrate that it is possible to achieve sustainable bioconversion of waste products from the dairy industry (RWP) and corn milling industry (CSLH) to ethanol and the process developed shows great potential for commercial realization.},

abstract = {A diploid strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae able to metabolize lactose with high efficiency has been obtained. Haploid strains of Saccharomyces able to grow on lactose were constructed by cotransformation with two genes of Kluyveromyces lactis required for the utilization of the sugar, LAC4 and LAC12, encoding $\beta$-galactosidase and lactose permease respectively. Both genes were placed under the control of a galactose-inducible promoter and targeted to the rDNA encoding region (RDN1 locus) of the Saccharomyces genome. Lac+ transformants were selected on medium with lactose as the only carbon source. These transformants were mitotically stable, they maintained the Lac+ phenotype after growing in non-selective medium for more than 60 generations, but their growth was slow. We found that this lack of vigour was caused by their genetic background and not by a deficient expression of the heterologous genes. Therefore, their performance could be improved by crossing with a wild-type strain. Among the offspring of the crosses, two strains of opposite mating type were selected and mated to obtain a fast- growing Lac+ diploid. This diploid strain showed the typical fermentative behaviour of S. cerevisiae when it was grown in aerated liquid medium with glucose. In lactose medium, it exhibited a respiro-fermentative metabolism similar to that of K. lactis, with low ethanol production and high biomass yield.},

abstract = {Methylmercury bioaccumulates in aquatic food chains and is able to cross the blood-brain barrier, making this organometallic compound a much more worrisome pollutant than inorganic mercury. We know that methylation of inorganic mercury is carried out by microbes in the anoxic layers of sediments and water columns, but the factors that control the extent of this methylation are poorly known. Mercury methylation is generally thought to be catalysed accidentally by some methylating enzyme, and it has been suggested that cellular mercury uptake results from passive diffusion of neutral mercury complexes. Here, we show that mercury methylation by the bacterium Geobacter sulfurreducens is greatly enhanced in the presence of low concentrations of the amino acid cysteine. The formation of a mercury-cysteine complex promotes both the uptake of inorganic mercury by the bacteria and the enzymatic formation of methylmercury, which is subsequently released to the external medium. Our results suggest that mercury uptake and methylation by microbes are controlled more tightly by biological mechanisms than previously thought, and that the formation of specific mercury complexes in anoxic waters modulates the efficiency of the microbial methylation of mercury. {\textcopyright} 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

abstract = {Large quantities of organic carbon are stored in frozen soils (permafrost) within Arctic and sub-Arctic regions. A warming climate can induce environmental changes that accelerate the microbial breakdown of organic carbon and the release of the greenhouse gases carbon dioxide and methane. This feedback can accelerate climate change, but the magnitude and timing of greenhouse gas emission from these regions and their impact on climate change remain uncertain. Here we find that current evidence suggests a gradual and prolonged release of greenhouse gas emissions in a warming climate and present a research strategy with which to target poorly understood aspects of permafrost carbon dynamics},

abstract = {Ethanol production by K. marxianus in whey from organic cheese production was examined in batch and continuous mode. The results showed that no pasteurization or freezing of the whey was necessary and that K. marxianus was able to compete with the lactic acid bacteria added during cheese production. The results also showed that, even though some lactic acid fermentation had taken place prior to ethanol fermentation, K. marxianus was able to take over and produce ethanol from the remaining lactose, since a significant amount of lactic acid was not produced (1-2 g/l). Batch fermentations showed high ethanol yield ({\~{}}0.50 g ethanol/g lactose) at both 30°C and 40°C using low pH (4.5) or no pH control. Continuous fermentation of nonsterilized whey was performed using Ca-alginate-immobilized K. marxianus. High ethanol productivity (2.5-4.5 g/l/h) was achieved at dilution rate of 0.2/h, and it was concluded that K. marxianus is very suitable for industrial ethanol production from whey. {\textcopyright} 2010 Society for Industrial Microbiology.},

In most tilapia tissues, the MIPS(s) transcript exhibits much higher abundance (generally {\textgreater}10-fold) with the exception of white skeletal muscle and oocytes, in which the MIPS(l) transcript predominates. SW acclimation resulted in large (6- to 32-fold) increases in mRNA expression for both MIPS(s) and MIPS(l) in all tilapia tissues tested, whereas in the eel, changes in expression were limited to a more modest 2.5-fold increase and only in the kidney.

abstract = {Culturing a population of Saccharomyces cerevisiae for many generations under conditions to which it is not optimally adapted selects for fitter genetic variants. This simple experimental design provides a tractable model of adaptive evolution under natural selection. Beginning with a clonal, founding population, independently evolved strains were obtained from three independent cultures after continuous aerobic growth in glucose-limited chemostats for more than 250 generations. DNA microarrays were used to compare genome-wide patterns of gene expression in the evolved strains and the parental strain. Several hundred genes were found to have significantly altered expression in the evolved strains. Many of these genes showed similar alterations in their expression in all three evolved strains. Genes with altered expression in the three evolved strains included genes involved in glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, and metabolite transport. These results are consistent with physiological observations and indicate that increased fitness is acquired by altering regulation of central metabolism such that less glucose is fermented and more glucose is completely oxidized.},

abstract = {With their application as seed coatings, the use of neonicotinoid insecticides increased dramatically during the last decade. They are now frequently detected in aquatic ecosystems at concentrations susceptible to harm aquatic invertebrates at individual and population levels. This study intent was to document surface runoff and subsurface tile drain losses of two common neonicotinoids (thiamethoxam and clothianidin) compared to those of companion herbicides (atrazine, glyphosate, S-metolachlor and mesotrione) at the edge of a 22.5-ha field under a corn-soybean rotation. A total of 14 surface runoff and tile drain discharge events were sampled over two years. Events and annual unit mass losses were computed using flow-weighted concentrations and total surface runoff and tile drain flow volumes. Detection frequencies close to 100{\%} in edge-of-field surface runoff and tile drain water samples were observed for thiamethoxam and clothianidin even though only thiamethoxam had been applied in the first year. In 2014, thiamethoxam median concentrations in surface runoff and tile drain samples were respectively 0.46 and 0.16 $\mu$g/L, while respective maximum concentrations of 2.20 and 0.44 $\mu$g/L were measured in surface runoff and tile drain samples during the first post-seeding storm event. For clothianidin, median concentrations in surface runoff and tile drain samples were 0.02 and 0.01, $\mu$g/L, and respective maximum concentrations were 0.07 $\mu$g/L and 0.05 $\mu$g/L. Surface runoff and tile drain discharge were key transport mechanisms with similar contributions of 53 and 47{\%} of measured mass losses, respectively. Even if thiamethoxam was applied at a relatively low rate and had a low mass exportation value (0.3{\%}), the relative toxicity was one to two orders of magnitude higher than those of the other chemicals applied in 2014 and 2015. Companion herbicides, except glyphosate in tile drains, exceeded their water quality guideline during one sampling campaign after application but rapidly resumed below these limits.},

abstract = {The geochemistry, mineralogy and microbiology of bacteriogenic iron oxides (BIOS) deposited at a circumneutral groundwater seep were examined to evaluate the biogeochemical controls on the redox cycle of iron in such environments. X-ray diffraction and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy showed that 2-line ferrihydrite dominated (60-70{\%}) the BIOS mineralogy, with more crystalline lepidocrocite and goethite phases comprising the remainder, likely the product of Fe(II)-induced dissolution-reprecipitation pathways. Subsurface porewater profiles displayed an increase in dissolved ({\textless} 0.2 $\mu$m) equilibrium concentrations of Fe(II), also reflected in peaks in HCl-extractable sedimentary Fe(II) at depth, indicative of biological iron reduction. Interestingly EXAFS analysis of sediments collected from such depths revealed little mineralogical change from the surficial BIOS. Dissolved concentrations of Fe(III), likely present as nanoparticulates or organic complexes, also rose with depth. Scanning electron microscopy images of the surface BIOS samples showed a proliferation of sheath structures characteristic of Fe(II)-oxidizing Leptothrix spp. A 16S rRNA clone library obtained from the surficial BIOS included microorganisms closely associated to known Fe(II)-oxidizing (Gallionella spp., Sideroxydans spp.) and Fe(III)-reducing (Rhodoferax ferrireducens and Geothrix fermentans) bacteria. Analysis of subsurface sediment collected from an Fe(III)-reducing horizon revealed a drop in the proportion of $\beta$-Proteobacteria, which hosts numerous Fe(II)-oxidizing genera, and a rise in the $\beta$-Proteobacteria, home to anaerobic metal-reducing prokaryotes. The recognition of clones with close identity to bacteria intimately involved in complementary iron redox transformations in the same surficial BIOS sediment suggests that microbial oxidation and reduction of iron may be tightly coupled in this, and other, shallow sedimentary environments. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The Chernobyl accident, which occurred April 26, 1986, resulted in a large release of radionuclides, which were deposited over a very wide area, particularly in Europe. Although an increased risk of thyroid cancer in exposed children has been clearly demonstrated in the most contaminated regions, the impact of the accident on the risk of other cancers as well as elsewhere in Europe is less clear. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the human cancer burden in Europe as a whole from radioactive fallout from the accident. Average country- and region-specific whole-body and thyroid doses from Chernobyl were estimated using new dosimetric models and radiological data. Numbers of cancer cases and deaths possibly attributable to radiation from Chernobyl were estimated, applying state-of-the-art risk models derived from studies of other irradiated populations. Simultaneously, trends in cancer incidence and mortality were examined over time and by dose level. The risk projections suggest that by now Chernobyl may have caused about 1,000 cases of thyroid cancer and 4,000 cases of other cancers in Europe, representing about 0.01{\%} of all incident cancers since the accident. Models predict that by 2065 about 16,000 (95{\%} UI 3,400-72,000) cases of thyroid cancer and 25,000 (95{\%} UI 11,000-59,000) cases of other cancers may be expected due to radiation from the accident, whereas several hundred million cancer cases are expected from other causes. Although these estimates are subject to considerable uncertainty, they provide an indication of the order of magnitude of the possible impact of the Chernobyl accident. It is unlikely that the cancer burden from the largest radiological accident to date could be detected by monitoring national cancer statistics. Indeed, results of analyses of time trends in cancer incidence and mortality in Europe do not, at present, indicate any increase in cancer rates-other than of thyroid cancer in the most contaminated regions-that can be clearly attributed to radiation from the Chernobyl accident. {\textcopyright} 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract = {Alcoholic fermentation is an essential step in wine production that is usually conducted by yeasts belonging to the species Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The ability to carry out vinification is largely influenced by the response of yeast cells to the stress conditions that affect them during this process. In this work, we present a systematic analysis of the resistance of 14 commercial S. cerevisiae wine yeast strains to heat shock, ethanol, oxidative, osmotic and glucose starvation stresses. Significant differences were found between these yeast strains under certain severe conditions, Vitilevure Pris Mouse and Lalvin T73 being the most resistant strains, while Fermi-blanc arom SM102 and UCLM S235 were the most sensitive ones. Induction of the expression of the HSP12 and HSP104 genes was analyzed. These genes are reported to be involved in the tolerance to several stress conditions in laboratory yeast strains. Our results indicate that each commercial strain shows a unique pattern of gene expression, and no clear correlation between the induction levels of either gene and stress resistance under the conditions tested was found. However, the increase in mRNA levels in both genes under heat shock indicates that the molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of their expression by stress function in all of the strains.},

To improve the efficiency of the plant and analyze the life cycle energy usage and emissions from the sugar industry, a complete Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is needed. A major portion of sugar is produced from sugarcane. Sugar is produced as the main consumable product; molasses and bagasse are byproducts and filter cake is a waste product. These byproducts and waste products are used again for different purposes. The capacity of sugar plants in the present study is 12,000 tons of cane per day in a sugar mill, 60 MW in a cogeneration power plant, and 270 kL per day in a distillery. The LCA mainly focuses on primary energy usage and its externalities. In this chapter, energy usage and GHG emissions from the sugar industry were obtained through an economic input-output model. A comparative analysis of GHG emission has also been carried out using a process chain analysis approach.},

abstract = {Yeasts have a long tradition of application in biotechnology and a more recent history of use as research models for biochemistry, metabolism, genetics and cell biology. Without doubt, Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been the dominant representative in all these aspects. There is tremendous diversity among yeasts, however, and the application of modern microbiological and molecular approaches has resulted in renewed focus on the biology and industrial potential of other yeasts. The dairy yeast Kluyveromyces marxianus is of particular interest in this regard because of traits that render it especially suitable for industrial application. These include the fastest growth rate of any eukaryotic microbe, thermotolerance, the capacity to assimilate a wide range of sugars, secretion of lytic enzymes, and the production of ethanol by fermentation. Despite the importance of these traits, and significant exploitation by the biotechnology sector, fundamental research with K. marxianus is just emerging from the shadow of its sister species, Kluyveromyces lactis. The availability of new molecular tools and resources for K. marxianus, its interesting metabolic and cellular traits, and the potential to become the leading yeast for many biotechnological processes, argue strongly for increased research into this particular species. {\textcopyright} 2010 The British Mycological Society.},

abstract = {The pollution of the environment with toxic metals is a result of many human activities, such as mining and metallurgy, and the effects of these metals on the ecosystems are of large economic and public-health significance. This paper presents the features and advantages of the unconventional removal method of heavy metals - biosorption - as a part of bioremediation. Bioremediation consists of a group of applications, which involve the detoxification of hazardous substances instead of transferring them from one medium to another, by means of microbes and plants. This process is characterized as less disruptive and can be often carried out on site, eliminating the need to transport the toxic materials to treatment sites. The biosorption (sorption of metallic ions from solutions by live or dried biomass) offers an alternative to the remediation of industrial effluents as well as the recovery of metals contained in other media. Biosorbents are prepared from naturally abundant and/or waste biomass. Due to the high uptake capacity and very cost-effective source of the raw material, biosorption is a progression towards a perspective method. The mechanism by which microorganisms take up metals is relatively unclear, but it has been demonstrated that both living and non-living biomass may be utilized in biosorptive processes, as they often exhibit a marked tolerance towards metals and other adverse conditions. One of their major advantages is the treatment of large volumes of effluents with low concentrations of pollutants. Models developed were presented to determine both the number of adsorption sites required to bind each metal ion and the rate of adsorption, using a batch reactor mass balance and the Langmuir theory of adsorption to surfaces or continuous dynamic systems. Two main categories of bioreactors used in bioremediation - suspended growth and fixed film bioreactors - are discussed. Reactors with varying configurations to meet the different requirements for biosorption are analyzed considering two major groups of reactors - batch reactors and continuous reactors. Biosorption is treated as an emerging technology effective in removing even very low levels of heavy metal. {\textcopyright} 2004 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH {\&} Co. KGaA, Weinheim.},

In 1976, a Canadian Wetland Classification System (CWCS) was initiated which evolved into the Federal Policy on Wetland Conservation in 1991. The CWCS has developed in close association with wetland policy in Canada since then and is based on a three-level classification: Five wetland classes (bog, fen, swamp, marsh, and shallow waters); wetland forms based on surface morphology, surface pattern, water type, and underlying soil morphology; and an open-ended number of wetland types based on physiognomic characteristics of vegetation communities. The "wetland type" level recognizes that field-level wetland classification and mapping requires practical local experience and input. The currently 49 wetland types used in the CWCS reflect vegetation communities, such as shrub, treed, graminoid, moss, lichen, and aquatics. This level allows regional approaches to site-level wetland classification to be part of the system.},

Mutagenesis of the transcription factor Spt15p and selection led to dominant mutations that conferred increased tolerance and more efficient glucose conversion to ethanol. The desired phenotype results from the combined effect of three separate mutations in the SPT15 gene serine substituted for phenylalanine (Phe(177)Ser) and, similarly, Tyr(195)His, and Lys(218)Arg. Thus, gTME can provide a route to complex phenotypes that are not readily accessible by traditional methods.},

abstract = {Methanol has been historically considered an exogenous product that leads only to pathological changes in the human body when consumed. However, in normal, healthy individuals, methanol and its short-lived oxidized product, formaldehyde, are naturally occurring compounds whose functions and origins have received limited attention. There are several sources of human physiological methanol. Fruits, vegetables, and alcoholic beverages are likely the main sources of exogenous methanol in the healthy human body. Metabolic methanol may occur as a result of fermentation by gut bacteria and metabolic processes involving S-adenosyl methionine. Regardless of its source, low levels of methanol in the body are maintained by physiological and metabolic clearance mechanisms. Although human blood contains small amounts of methanol and formaldehyde, the content of these molecules increases sharply after receiving even methanolfree ethanol, indicating an endogenous source of the metabolic methanol present at low levels in the blood regulated by a cluster of genes. Recent studies of the pathogenesis of neurological disorders indicate metabolic formaldehyde as a putative causative agent. The detection of increased formaldehyde content in the blood of both neurological patients and the elderly indicates the important role of genetic and biochemical mechanisms of maintaining low levels of methanol and formaldehyde.},

abstract = {In yeasts, proteins of the Major Superfamily Transporter selectively bind and allow the uptake of sugars to permit growth on varied substrates. The genome of brewer's yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, encodes multiple hexose transporters (Hxt) to transport glucose and other MFS proteins for maltose, galactose, and other monomers. For sugar uptake, the dairy yeast, Kluyveromyces lactis, uses Rag1p for glucose, Hgt1 for glucose and galactose, and Lac12 for lactose. In the related industrial species Kluyveromyces marxianus, there are four genes encoding Lac12-like proteins but only one of them, Lac12, can transport lactose. In this study, which initiated with efforts to investigate possible functions encoded by the additional LAC12 genes in K. marxianus, a genome-wide survey of putative MFS sugar transporters was performed. Unexpectedly, it was found that the KHT and the HGT genes are present as tandem arrays of five to six copies, with the precise number varying between isolates. Heterologous expression of individual genes in S. cerevisiae and mutagenesis of single and multiple genes in K. marxianus was performed to establish possible substrates for these transporters. The focus was on the sugar galactose since it was already reported in K. lactis that this hexose was a substrate for both Lac12 and Hgt1. It emerged that three of the four copies of Lac12, four Hgt-like proteins and one Kht-like protein have some capacity to transport galactose when expressed in S. cerevisiae and inactivation of all eight genes was required to completely abolish galactose uptake in K. marxianus. Analysis of the amino acid sequence of all known yeast galactose transporters failed to identify common residues that explain the selectivity for galactose. Instead, the capacity to transport galactose has arisen three different times in K. marxianus via polymorphisms in proteins that are probably ancestral glucose transporters. Although, this is analogous to S. cerevisiae, in which Gal2 is related to glucose transporters, there are not conserved amino acid changes, either with Gal2, or among the K. marxianus galactose transporters. The data highlight how gene duplication and functional diversification has provided K. marxianus with versatile capacity to utilise sugars for growth.},

Analysis of cell wall proteins, either by sodium dodecyl sulphate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of extractable mannoproteins or by immunolocalization, revealed an accumulation of a protein with Mr 37 kDa (p37), upon flocculation. Immunological studies confirmed the homology of this protein with the glycolytic enzyme glyceraldehyde‐3‐phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). When mRNA isolated from cells growing at 40°C was translated in vitro, a 35 kDa newly labelled protein was synthesized and immunoprecipitation assays showed that this protein is recognized by p37‐antiserum, suggesting that the 35 kDa polypeptide might be an unglycosylated precursor form of p37. The results indicated that the presence of this cell wall mannoprotein closely related to GAPDH is dependent on the growth temperature, suggesting its role as adhesin.

abstract = {Lactose is an interesting carbon source for the production of several bio-products by fermentation, primarily because it is the major component of cheese whey, the main by-product of dairy activities. However, the microorganism more widely used in industrial fermentation processes, the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, does not have a lactose metabolization system. Therefore, several metabolic engineering approaches have been used to construct lactose-consuming S. cerevisiae strains, particularly involving the expression of the lactose genes of the phylogenetically related yeast Kluyveromyces lactis, but also the lactose genes from Escherichia coli and Aspergillus niger, as reviewed here. Due to the existing large amounts of whey, the production of bio-ethanol from lactose by engineered S. cerevisiae has been considered as a possible route for whey surplus. Emphasis is given in the present review on strain improvement for lactose-to-ethanol bioprocesses, namely flocculent yeast strains for continuous high-cell-density systems with enhanced ethanol productivity. {\textcopyright} 2010 Landes Bioscience.},

The distillery effluents did not affect the oil content ({\%}), crude and true protein contents ({\%}) in groundnut but increased the seed yield and the contents of methionine by 44{\%} (1.15 g (16 g N)-1 vs. 0.80 g (16 g N)-1 in control) and of cysteine by 24{\%} (1.36 g (16 g N)-1 vs. 1.10 g (16 g N)-1 in control). BSW produced the highest seed yield (619 kg ha-1) followed by RSW (557 kg ha -1) and LS (472 kg ha-1). LS recorded the highest total chlorophyll content (2.94 mg (g FW)-1) in groundnut leaves. Application of BSW and RSW significantly increased the activity of plant peroxidase whereas the plant polyphenol oxidase was higher in BSW only. The application of distillery effluents did not affect the nitrate reductase activity but BSW significantly increased the nitrate content in the rhizosphere soil. The three effluents significantly increased the dehydrogenase and alkaline phosphatase activity more than recommended NPK+FYM.},

abstract = {A field study was carried out to monitor the effect of application of molasses based distillery effluent on yields of sugarcane and soil properties. The treatments consisted of main plots: control (I0), first pre-sowing irrigation with undiluted effluent (I1), one irrigation with effluent: tube-well water (1:3) at tillering stage (I2), two irrigations with effluent: tube-well water (1:4) at tillering and 30 d after tillering stage (I3). The subplots either received no fertilizer application (F0) or had 50 {\%} of recommended dose (50 kg N, 60 kg P2O5 and 40 kg K2O ha-1 as basal dose (F1) with top dressing of 50 kg N ha-1 at tillering and in June before the onset of monsoon. Nitrogen to the ratoon crops was applied in three equal splits. Application of 50 {\%} recommended fertilizer dose increased the cumulative cane yields under different effluent treatments. Use of distillery effluent irrespective of the method of application significantly increased the cumulative yields of sugarcane over no application of effluent significantly at p ≤ 0. 05. After the harvest of second ratoon crop, no significant effect of different treatments was noted on soil pH, electrical conductance and exchangeable Na. Significantly higher build-up of organic C in surface soil was noted under I2 treatment in comparison to I0 treatment at p ≤ 0. 05. With no fertilizer application, both I1 and I2 significantly increased accumulation of alkaline KMnO4 hydrolysable N in 30-45 cm layer in comparison to I0F0 at p ≤ 0. 05. In comparison to I0, use of I2 increased the content of Olsen's P significantly (p ≤ 0. 05) in 30-45 and 45-60 cm layers while I3 increased it significantly at p ≤ 0. 05 in 0-15 and 45-60 cm layers. Use of distillery effluent as pre-sowing or standing crop irrigation increased ammonium acetate extractable K in surface and sub-surface layers significantly in comparison to I0 at p ≤ 0. 05. Thus, use of distillery effluent in sugarcane crop as pre-sown or standing crop irrigation had no adverse impact on soil reaction or electrical conductivity and could save at least fifty percent of basal NPK application with significantly higher cumulative millable cane yields of main crop and two subsequent ratoons. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {Changes in the mineralogy, microbial community structure and aquatic geochemistry of bacteriogenic iron oxides (BIOS) deposited at a circumneutral groundwater seep were recorded seasonally. X-ray diffraction and X-ray absorption spectroscopy demonstrated that 2-line ferrihydrite dominated the iron-bearing mineralogy of the BIOS ({\textgreater}60{\%}). Minor proportions of the more crystalline lepidocrocite were also detected in BIOS collected throughout the year ({\textless}30{\%}), but goethite ({\textless}15{\%}) was only identified in sediments collected during the spring, summer and fall months. Subsurface porewater profiles generally showed an increase in dissolved equilibrium concentrations of Fe(II), indicative of microbial Fe(III) reduction, and the depth at which appreciable levels of dissolved Fe(II) (and to a lesser extent manganese) arose, and sulfate concentrations declined, become shallower as the seasons progressed from spring to fall. Clone libraries constructed from 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis of surficial BIOS showed the presence of sequences closely affiliated to known Fe(II)-oxidizing and Fe(III)-reducing prokaryotes, pointing towards a tightly coupled microbial iron cycle. Clones that showed closest identity to Fe(II)-oxidizing bacteria in culture, including Gallionella spp. and Sideroxydans spp., made up a significant portion of the clone library, but their relative proportion declined through the winter (73{\%}), spring (26{\%}) and summer (9{\%}). The dominance of the putative microaerophilic Fe(II)-oxidizing chemolithoautotrophs in the winter clone library may be partly due to the lower temperature and dissolved organic carbon concentrations observed during this season, conditions that could have limited mixotrophic or organotrophic growth by mesophilic bacteria.

Twenty-four male rats were included in this 90-day study, starting at 7days of age. The rats were divided into four groups. The first group was used as control. The second, third and fourth groups received oral 0.5-, 2- and 8-mg/kg imidacloprid, respectively. Serum, sperm and testis samples were collected from all groups at the end of the experimental period. The weights of the epididymis, vesicula seminalis, epididymal sperm concentration, body weight gain, testosterone and reduced glutathione values were lower in the imidacloprid-treated groups than that in the controls. All treated groups had increased lipid peroxidation, fatty acid concentrations and higher rates of abnormal sperm. Apoptosis and fragmentation of seminal DNA were higher in rats treated at the two higher doses of imidacloprid. These results show that this compound has a negative effect on sperm and testis of rats. {\textcopyright} 2012 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {Permafrost soils are an important reservoir of carbon (C) in boreal and arctic ecosystems. Rising global temperature is expected to enhance decomposition of organic matter frozen in permafrost, and may cause positive feedback to warming as CO(2) is released to the atmosphere. Significant amounts of organic matter remain frozen in thick mineral soil (loess) deposits in northeastern Siberia, but the quantity and lability of this deep organic C is poorly known. Soils from four tundra and boreal forest locations in northeastern Siberia that have been continuously frozen since the Pleistocene were incubated at controlled temperatures (5, 10 and 15 degrees C) to determine their potential to release C to the atmosphere when thawed. Across all sites, CO(2) with radiocarbon ((14)C) ages ranging between similar to 21 and 24 ka BP was respired when these permafrost soils were thawed. The amount of C released in the first several months was strongly correlated to C concentration in the bulk soil in the different sites, and this correlation remained the same for fluxes up to 1 year later. Fluxes were initially strongly related to temperature with a mean Q(10) value of 1.9 +/- 0.3 across all sites, and later were unrelated to temperature but still correlated with bulk soil C concentration. Modeled inversions of Delta(14)CO(2) values in respiration CO(2) and soil C components revealed mean contribution of 70{\%} and 26{\%} from dissolved organic C to respiration CO(2) in case of two permafrost soils, while organic matter fragments dominated respiration (mean 68{\%}) from a surface mineral soil that served as modern reference sample. Our results suggest that if 10{\%} of the total Siberian permafrost C pool was thawed to a temperature of 5 degrees C, about 1 Pg C will be initially released from labile C pools, followed by respiration of similar to 40 Pg C to the atmosphere over a period of four decades.},

abstract = {Many physiological responses in present-day coral reefs to climate change are interpreted as consistent with the imminent disappearance of modern reefs globally because of annual mass bleaching events, carbonate dissolution, and insufficient time for substantial evolutionary responses. Emerging evidence for variability in the coral calcification response to acidification, geographical variation in bleaching susceptibility and recovery, responses to past climate change, and potential rates of adaptation to rapid warming supports an alternative scenario in which reef degradation occurs with greater temporal and spatial heterogeneity than current projections suggest. Reducing uncertainty in projecting coral reef futures requires improved understanding of past responses to rapid climate change; physiological responses to interacting factors, such as temperature, acidification, and nutrients; and the costs and constraints imposed by acclimation and adaptation.},

abstract = {The aim of this work was to investigate the physiology of Kluyveromyces marxianus CBS 6556 in terms of its low tendency to form ethanol under exposure to sugar excess, and the split of carbon flux which takes place at the level of glucose-6-phosphate. Measurements were performed in batch cultivations, and after a glucose or a lactose pulse applied to chemostat-grown respiring cells (with a dilution rate of 0.1 h-1). No ethanol formation was observed in batch cultivations or during pulse experiments, unless the oxygen supply was shut down, indicating that this organism is more strictly Crabtree-negative than its close relative K. lactis and other known Crabtree-negative yeasts. During the pulse experiments, activities of phosphoglucoisomerase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and phosphoglucomutase in cell-free extracts remained rather constant, at higher levels than those of Saccharomyces cerevisiae grown at similar conditions. When cells were exposed to glucose concentrations as high as 26 gl-1, the activity of phosphoglucomutase was higher than that in cells exposed to 14 gl-1 glucose, whereas the activities of phosphoglucoisomerase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase did not change. Our results suggest that the low tendency for ethanol formation in K. marxianus might be a consequence of this yeast's capacity of keeping the glycolytic flux constant, due at least in part to the diversion of carbon flux towards the biosynthesis of carbohydrates and towards the pentose phosphate pathway. {\textcopyright} 2004 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

abstract = {We assessed the state of knowledge regarding the effects of large-scale pollution with neonicotinoid insecticides and fipronil on non-target invertebrate species of terrestrial, freshwater and marine environments. A large section of the assessment is dedicated to the state of knowledge on sublethal effects on honeybees (Apis mellifera) because this important pollinator is the most studied non-target invertebrate species. Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths), Lumbricidae (earthworms), Apoidae sensu lato (bumblebees, solitary bees) and the section “other invertebrates” review available studies on the other terrestrial species. The sections on freshwater and marine species are rather short as little is known so far about the impact of neonicotinoid insecticides and fipronil on the diverse invertebrate fauna of these widely exposed habitats. For terrestrial and aquatic invertebrate species, the known effects of neonicotinoid pesticides and fipronil are described ranging from organismal toxicology and behavioural effects to population-level effects. For earthworms, freshwater and marine species, the relation of findings to regulatory risk assessment is described. Neonicotinoid insecticides exhibit very high toxicity to a wide range of invertebrates, particularly insects, and field-realistic exposure is likely to result in both lethal and a broad range of important sublethal impacts. There is a major knowledge gap regarding impacts on the grand majority of invertebrates, many of which perform essential roles enabling healthy ecosystem functioning. The data on the few non-target species on which field tests have been performed are limited by major flaws in the outdated test protocols. Despite large knowledge gaps and uncertainties, enough knowledge exists to conclude that existing levels of pollution with neonicotinoids and fipronil resulting from presently authorized uses frequently exceed the lowest observed adverse effect concentrations and are thus likely to have large-scale and wide ranging negative biological and ecological impacts on a wide range of non-target invertebrates in terrestrial, aquatic, marine and benthic habitats.},

abstract = {Reducing food losses and waste is considered to be one of the most promising measures to improve food security in the coming decades. Food losses also affect our use of resources, such as freshwater, cropland, and fertilisers. In this paper we estimate the global food supply losses due to lost and wasted food crops, and the resources used to produce them. We also quantify the potential food supply and resource savings that could be made by reducing food losses and waste. We used publically available global databases to conduct the study at the country level.We found that around one quarter of the produced food supply (614kcal/cap/day) is lost within the food supply chain (FSC). The production of these lost and wasted food crops accounts for 24{\%} of total freshwater resources used in food crop production (27m3/cap/yr), 23{\%} of total global cropland area (31×10-3ha/cap/yr), and 23{\%} of total global fertiliser use (4.3kg/cap/yr). The per capita use of resources for food losses is largest in North Africa {\&} West-Central Asia (freshwater and cropland) and North America {\&} Oceania (fertilisers). The smallest per capita use of resources for food losses is found in Sub-Saharan Africa (freshwater and fertilisers) and in Industrialised Asia (cropland). Relative to total food production, the smallest food supply and resource losses occur in South {\&} Southeast Asia.If the lowest loss and waste percentages achieved in any region in each step of the FSC could be reached globally, food supply losses could be halved. By doing this, there would be enough food for approximately one billion extra people. Reducing the food losses and waste would thus be an important step towards increased food security, and would also increase the efficiency of resource use in food production. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Distillery effluents, a major by-product of distilleries are a major environmental hazard as they are rich in organic matter, micro- and macroelements. Management of this enormous amount of nutrient-rich effluent and its effective utilization is a major challenge. These effluents can be used as a source of nutrient by C4 crops like sugarcane and subsequent ratoon crops under fertigation system. Impact of fertigation in sugarcane-ratoon cropping system on soil microbial biomass is important as the microbial population plays an important role in the nutrient and biogeochemical recycling. Keeping this in mind, a field experiment was carried out in the sandy loam soil of semi-arid to humid sub-tropical climate of Gajraula (28.85°N, 78.23°E) region, India with different doses of diluted and undiluted effluent for fertigation of sugarcane crop in presence and absence of 50 {\%} recommended dose of fertilizers with suitable replicates. Two post-sown irrigations with four times diluted effluent gave the maximum yield in case of sugarcane crop. Taking into consideration the yield and the culturable microbial population sizes, it can be concluded that one to two post-sown irrigations with diluted effluent can be used to enhance soil fertility in terms of microbial population and to enhance sugarcane and ratoon crop productivity. This package is economically viable and can also take care of distillery waste management and reduction in consumption of chemical fertilizers by 50 {\%}, a key for sustainable agricultural development.},

abstract = {Amphibian populations are declining globally at an alarming rate. Pesticides are among a number of proposed causes for these declines. Although a sizable database examining effects of pesticides on amphibians exists, the vast majority of these studies focus on toxicological effects (lethality, external malformations, etc.) at relatively high doses (parts per million). Very few studies focus on effects such as endocrine disruption at low concentrations. Further, most studies examine exposures to single chemicals only. The present study examined nine pesticides (four herbicides, two fungicides, and three insecticides) used on cornfields in the midwestern United States. Effects of each pesticide alone (0.1 ppb) or in combination were examined. In addition, we also examined atrazine and S-metolachlor combined (0.1 or 10 ppb each) and the commercial formulation Bicep II Magnum, which contains both of these herbicides. These two pesticides were examined in combination because they are persistent throughout the year in the wild. We examined larval growth and development, sex differentiation, and immune function in leopard frogs (Rana pipiens). In a follow-up study, we also examined the effects of the nine-compound mixture on plasma corticosterone levels in male African clawed frogs (Xenopus laevis). Although some of the pesticides individually inhibited larval growth and development, the pesticide mixtures had much greater effects. Larval growth and development were retarded, but most significantly, pesticide mixtures negated or reversed the typically positive correlation between time to metamorphosis and size at metamorphosis observed in controls: exposed larvae that took longer to metamorphose were smaller than their counterparts that metamorphosed earlier. The nine-pesticide mixture also induced damage to the thymus, resulting in immunosuppression and contraction of flavobacterial meningitis. The study in X. laevis revealed that these adverse effects may be due to an increase in plasma levels of the stress hormone corticosterone. Although it cannot be determined whether all the pesticides in the mixture contribute to these adverse effects or whether some pesticides are effectors, some are enhancers, and some are neutral, the present study revealed that estimating ecological risk and the impact of pesticides on amphibians using studies that examine only single pesticides at high concentrations may lead to gross underestimations of the role of pesticides in amphibian declines.},

Carbonated flavoured drinks may experience flavour fade over the course of sensory shelf life, whereas beverages such as wine and whiskey can actually improve with age. Microbiological shelf life is discussed because of its importance in nonalcoholic beverages and beer quality. However, this is less important for other alcoholic beverages, such as spirits, with higher alcohol levels due to the antimicrobial nature of ethanol thus sensory quality is the primary means of defining shelf life. Some beverages may also undergo rheological changes, such as cream liqueurs, which can increase in viscosity over time depending on storage temperature and emulsion stability.},

Effects of initial pH, CWP concentration and external nutrient (N, P) supplementation on ethanol formation rate and extent were investigated. The initial pH was varied between 3 and 7. The most suitable initial pH maximizing the final ethanol yield was found to be 5. Nutritional requirements of the organisms were investigated by supplementing the CWP solution with external nitrogen and phosphate sources. The rate and extent of ethanol formation did not increase with external nutrient addition indicating the fact that the nitrogen and phosphorous content of CWP was sufficient for ethanol fermentation. CWP concentration was varied between 50 and 300 g l-1 with total sugar concentrations between 25 and 150 g l-1. Final ethanol concentration and the rate of ethanol formation increased with increasing CWP concentration indicating no substrate or product inhibitions, but substrate limitations. The yield coefficient of ethanol varied between 0.35 and 0.54 g ethanol g sugar-1 and reached the theoretical level (0.54 g EtOH g sugar-1) at 300 g l-1 CWP concentration. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc.

This is known as nitrogen catabolite repression (NCR). They bind to motifs in the promoter region to the consensus sequence 5' GATAA 3'. Gln3 and Gat1 act positively on gene expression whereas Dal80 and Deh1 act negatively. Expression of nitrogen catabolite pathway genes known to be regulated by these four regulators are glutamine, glutamate, proline, urea, arginine, GABA, and allantoine. In addition, the expression of the genes encoding the general amino acid permease and the ammonium permease are also regulated by these four regulatory proteins. Another group of genes whose expression is also regulated by Gln3, Gat1, Dal80, and Deh1 are some proteases, CPS1, PRB1, LAP1, and PEP4, responsible for the degradation of proteins into amino acids thereby providing a nitrogen source to the cell. In this review, all known promoter sequences related to expression of nitrogen catabolite pathways are discussed as well as other regulatory proteins.

abstract = {With their application as seed coatings, the use of neonicotinoid insecticides increased dramatically during the last decade. They are now frequently detected in aquatic ecosystems at concentrations susceptible to harm aquatic invertebrates at individual and population levels. This study intent was to document surface runoff and subsurface tile drain losses of two common neonicotinoids (thiamethoxam and clothianidin) compared to those of companion herbicides (atrazine, glyphosate, S-metolachlor and mesotrione) at the edge of a 22.5-ha field under a corn-soybean rotation. A total of 14 surface runoff and tile drain discharge events were sampled over two years. Events and annual unit mass losses were computed using flow-weighted concentrations and total surface runoff and tile drain flow volumes. Detection frequencies close to 100{\%} in edge-of-field surface runoff and tile drain water samples were observed for thiamethoxam and clothianidin even though only thiamethoxam had been applied in the first year. In 2014, thiamethoxam median concentrations in surface runoff and tile drain samples were respectively 0.46 and 0.16 $\mu$g/L, while respective maximum concentrations of 2.20 and 0.44 $\mu$g/L were measured in surface runoff and tile drain samples during the first post-seeding storm event. For clothianidin, median concentrations in surface runoff and tile drain samples were 0.02 and 0.01, $\mu$g/L, and respective maximum concentrations were 0.07 $\mu$g/L and 0.05 $\mu$g/L. Surface runoff and tile drain discharge were key transport mechanisms with similar contributions of 53 and 47{\%} of measured mass losses, respectively. Even if thiamethoxam was applied at a relatively low rate and had a low mass exportation value (0.3{\%}), the relative toxicity was one to two orders of magnitude higher than those of the other chemicals applied in 2014 and 2015. Companion herbicides, except glyphosate in tile drains, exceeded their water quality guideline during one sampling campaign after application but rapidly resumed below these limits.},

Nevertheless, the most abundant component in whey is lactose (ca. 5{\%} w/v), which represents a significant environmental problem. Due to the large lactose surplus generated, its conversion to bio-ethanol has long been considered as a possible solution for whey bioremediation. In this review, fermentation of lactose to ethanol is discussed, focusing on wild lactose-fermenting yeasts, particularly Kluyveromyces marxianus, and recombinant Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains. The early efforts in the screening and characterization of the fermentation properties of wild lactose-consuming yeasts are reviewed. Furthermore, emphasis is given on the latter advances in engineering S. cerevisiae strains for efficient whey-to-ethanol bioprocesses. Examples of industrial implementation are briefly discussed, illustrating the viability of whey-to-ethanol systems. Current developments on strain engineering together with the growing market for biofuels will likely boost the industrial interest in such processes. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Distilleries are among the most polluting industries because ethanol fermentation results in the discharge of large quantities of high-strength liquid effluents with high concentrations of organic matter and nitrogen compounds, low pH, high temperature, dark brown color, and high salinity. The most common method of managing this wastewater (distillery stillage) is to use it for soil conditioning, but this requires thickening the wastewater and may cause soil pollution due to its high nitrogen content. Therefore, treatment of distillery stillage is preferable. This review discusses individual biological and physico-chemical treatment methods and combined technologies. In addition, special attention is paid to valorization of distillery stillage, which is a valuable source of polysaccharides and volatile fatty acids (VFAs), as well as natural antioxidants, including polyphenols and other bioactive compounds of interest to the pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and food industries. New directions in improvement of valorization technologies are highlighted, including the search for new eutectic solvents for extracting these compounds.

abstract = {Cheese whey powder (CWP) is an attractive raw material for ethanol production since it is a dried and concentrated form of CW and contains lactose in addition to nitrogen, phosphate and other essential nutrients. In the present work, deproteinized CWP was utilized as fermentation medium for ethanol production by Kluyveromyces fragilis. The individual and combined effects of initial lactose concentration (50-150 kg m-3), temperature (25-35 °C) and inoculum concentration (1-3 kg m-3) were investigated through a 23 full-factorial central composite design, and the optimal conditions for maximizing the ethanol production were determined. According to the statistical analysis, in the studied range of values, only the initial lactose concentration had a significant effect on ethanol production, resulting in higher product formation as the initial substrate concentration was increased. Assays with initial lactose concentration varying from 150 to 250 kg m-3 were thus performed and revealed that the use of 200 kg m-3 initial lactose concentration, inoculum concentration of 1 kg m-3 and temperature of 35 °C were the best conditions for maximizing the ethanol production from CWP solution. Under these conditions, 80.95 kg m-3 of ethanol was obtained after 44 h of fermentation. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {1. Each of the three forms of milk-sugar shows two heats of solution according as the rate of the balanced reaction that occurs in milk-sugar solutions proceeds very slowly or very rapidly.In the former case the initial heat of solution is observed, in the latter the final heat of solution, which is the sum of the initial heat of solution and the heat generated bv the rapidly progressing reaction, called the heat of passage. 2. The following data on these heat effects at 20° have been determined with a calorimeter.Hydrated milk-sugar. [formula omitted] 3. The equality of the heat of passage of the hydrate and the $\alpha$-anhydride is further evidence supporting the accepted view that the $\beta$-anhydride passes instantly to hydrate wrhen dissolved, which then slowly builds $\beta$-anhydride according to the balanced reaction [formula omitted] 4. Evidence from two independent sources shows that the initial heat of solution of the hydrate increases about 0.1 calorie per degree rise in temperature. 5. The dilution of strong milk-sugar solutions (0.5 molal) causes a very slight development of heat, which cannot be due to any change in the equilibrium of the balanced reaction with concentration because the heat development at room temperature on dilution is instantaneous while any change of the balanced reaction at this temperature would be very slow. The heat of solution is independent of the concentration when this is less than about 0.3 molal. 6. Pure $\beta$-anhydrous milk-sugar has been prepared by an improved method of slow crystallization, and a delicate test shows that it is free from hydrate.Its specific gravity at 20° is 1.59, that of the hydrate being 1.54. 7. The present data on the heats of solution confirm quantitatively the view that the crystalline substance which alcohol and ether precipitate from cold stable milk-sugar solutions is not a pure substance as was first supposed but is a mechanical mixture of the hydrate and the $\beta$-anhydride.It does not show mutarotation when redissolved in water because the two substances are present in it in the same proportions approximately in which they occur in stable solutions.8.When the temperature of a stable solution of milk-sugar is suddenly changed a slight thermal lag is observed in its rotatory power, which indicates that the hydration is slightly increased with rise of temperature between 0° and 100°.The direction and magnitude of this lag agree with the conclusions drawn from the observed value of the heat of passage.9.The final heat of solution of hydrated milk-sugar is calculated from the solubilities at 150° and 250° to be 0−11.5, agreeing with the calorimetric measurement at 200°, which gives 0−11.4. {\textcopyright} 1908, American Chemical Society.

The selection of yeast strains was performed at different cultivation conditions: temperatures were 30 °C, 34 °C and 37 °C, respectively, and the concentration of lactose in the substrate varied from 5 {\%} to 15 {\%}. Cultivations were carried out in aerobic conditions on a rotary shaker, at pH 4,5-5,0. During cultivations the kinetics of alcoholic fermentations was analysed. Satisfactory results were achieved almost with all the yeast strains, but the best results were gained with K. marxianus VST 44 and ZIM 75, respectively. On the other hand, 34 °C seemed to be the optimal temperature for both strains. To optimize the process fed-batch cultivations were performed with the chosen strains of K. marxianus at 34 °C in aerobic/anaerobic conditions. The process ended after 12-14 hours. At the end of the process the biomass yield reached 10 g L-1 and the ethanol fraction was $\phi$ = 7,31 {\%}. The results achieved in all experiments showed that the selected yeast strains, K. marxianus VST 44 and ZIM 75, could be succesfully used in the ethanol and yeast biomass production on whey.},

abstract = {An outbreak of acute liver failure occurred at a dialysis center in Caruaru, Brazil(8°17′S, 35°58″W), 134 km from Recife, the state capital of Pernambuco. At the clinic, 116(89{\%}) of 131 patients experienced visual disturbances, nausea, and vomiting after routine hemodialysis treatment on 13-20 February 1996. Subsequently, 100 patients developed acute liver failure, and of these 76 died. As of December 1996, 52 of the deaths could be attributed to a common syndrome now called Caruaru syndrome. Examination of phytoplankton from the dialysis clinic's water source, analyses of the clinic's water treatments system, plus serum and liver tissue of clinic patients led to the identification of two groups of cyanobacterial toxins, the hepatotoxic cyclic peptide microcystins and the hepatotoxic alkaloid cylindrospermopsin. Comparison of victims' symptoms and pathology using animal studies of these two cyanotoxins leads us to conclude that the major contributing factor to death of the dialyses patients was intravenous exposure to microcystins, specifically microcystin-YR, -LR, and -AR. From liver concentrations and exposure volumes, it was estimated that 19.5 $\mu$g/L microcystin was in the water used for dialysis treatments. This is 19.5 times the level set as a guideline for safe drinking water supplies by the World Health Organization.},

This feedback can accelerate climate change, but the magnitude and timing of greenhouse gas emission from these regions and their impact on climate change remain uncertain.

abstract = {There is a strong demand from the wine industry for methodologies to reduce the alcohol content of wine without compromising wine's sensory characteristics. We assessed the potential of adaptive laboratory evolution strategies under hyperosmotic stress for generation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae wine yeast strains with enhanced glycerol and reduced ethanol yields. Experimental evolution on KCl resulted, after 200 generations, in strains that had higher glycerol and lower ethanol production than the ancestral strain. This major metabolic shift was accompanied by reduced fermentative capacities, suggesting a trade-off between high glycerol production and fermentation rate. Several evolved strains retaining good fermentation performance were selected. These strains produced more succinate and 2,3-butanediol than the ancestral strain and did not accumulate undesirable organoleptic compounds, such as acetate, acetaldehyde, or acetoin. They survived better under osmotic stress and glucose starvation conditions than the ancestral strain, suggesting that the forces that drove the redirection of carbon fluxes involved a combination of osmotic and salt stresses and carbon limitation. To further decrease the ethanol yield, a breeding strategy was used, generating intrastrain hybrids that produced more glycerol than the evolved strain. Pilot-scale fermentation on Syrah using evolved and hybrid strains produced wine with 0.6{\%} (vol/vol) and 1.3{\%} (vol/vol) less ethanol, more glycerol and 2,3-butanediol, and less acetate than the ancestral strain. This work demonstrates that the combination of adaptive evolution and breeding is a valuable alternative to rational design for remodeling the yeast metabolic network. {\textcopyright} 2014, American Society for Microbiology.},

abstract = {For nearly 100 years, epidemiologic studies of human populations exposed to ionising radiation have provided quantitative information on health risks. High dose deterministic (tissue reaction) effects result when sufficient numbers of functioning cells are killed, such as in bone marrow depression that can lead to death. Lower dose stochastic effects are probabilistic in nature and include an increased risk of cancer later in life and heritable genetic defects, although genetic conditions in the children of irradiated parents have yet to be convincingly demonstrated. Radiation studies are of diverse populations and include not only the Japanese atomic bomb survivors, but also patients treated with radiation for malignant and non-malignant disease; patients exposed for diagnostic purposes; persons with intakes of radionuclides; workers occupationally exposed; and communities exposed to environmental and accidentally released sources of radiation. Much is known about radiation and its risks. The major unanswered question in radiation epidemiology, however, is not whether radiation causes cancer, but what the level of risk is following low dose ({\textless}100mSv) or low dose rate exposures. Paracelsus is credited with first articulating that the 'poison is in the dose', which for radiation epidemiology translates as 'the lower the dose, the lower the risk' and, an important corollary, the lower the dose, the greater the difficulty in detecting any increase in the number of cancers possibly attributable to radiation. In contrast to the Chernobyl reactor accident, the Fukushima reactor accident has to date resulted in no deterministic effects and no worker deaths. Estimates to date of population doses suggest very low uptakes of radioactive iodine which was a major determinant of the epidemic of thyroid cancer following childhood exposures around Chernobyl. The estimates to date of population doses are also much lower (and the distribution much narrower) than the doses for which cancer excesses have been detected among atomic bomb survivors after 60 years of follow-up. Studies of populations exposed to low doses are also limited in their ability to account for important lifestyle factors, such as cigarette smoking and medical x-ray exposures, which could distort findings. Studies of the Fukushima population should be and are being considered for reassurance and health care reasons. Apart from as regards the extreme psychological stress caused by the horrific loss of life following the tsunami and the large-scale evacuation from homes and villages, such studies have limited to no chance of providing information on possible health risks following low dose exposures received gradually over time - the estimated doses (to date) are just too small. {\textcopyright} 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

Two whey-ethanol plants are currently operated by dairy cooperatives, producing a total of 8 million gallons a year. Successful operations of the plants since the 1980s indicate that (1) fuel ethanol production from whey is technically feasible, (2) whey-to-fuel ethanol production technologies and processes are mature and capable of being adopted for commercial operations, and (3) producing fuel ethanol from whey is economically feasible. However, in this era of whey products' price uncertainties, a key consideration in assessing the feasibility of a new whey-ethanol venture should be the valuation of the opportunity cost of whey as feedstock for fermentation. A new whey- ethanol plant probably should have an annual production capacity of at least 5 million gallons of ethanol. Some historical lessons on the pitfalls to avoid are summarized.},

abstract = {Elevated ocean temperatures can cause coral bleaching, the loss of colour from reefbuilding corals because of a breakdown of the symbiosis with the dinoflagellate Symbiodinium. Recent studies have warned that global climate change could increase the frequency of coral bleaching and threaten the long-term viability of coral reefs. These assertions are based on projecting the coarse output from atmosphere–ocean general circulation models (GCMs) to the local conditions around representative coral reefs. Here, we conduct the first comprehensive global assessment of coral bleaching under climate change by adapting the NOAA Coral ReefWatch bleaching prediction method to the output of a low- and high-climate sensitivity GCM. First, we develop and test algorithms for predicting mass coral bleaching with GCM-resolution sea surface temperatures for thousands of coral reefs, using a global coral reef map and 1985–2002 bleaching prediction data. We then use the algorithms to determine the frequency of coral bleaching and required thermal adaptation by corals and their endosymbionts under two different emissions scenarios. The results indicate that bleaching could become an annual or biannual event for the vast majority of the world's coral reefs in the next 30–50 years without an increase in thermal tolerance of 0.2–1.0 1C per decade. The geographic variability in required thermal adaptation found in each model and emissions scenario suggests that coral reefs in some regions, like Micronesia and western Polynesia, may be particularly vulnerable to climate change. Advances in modelling and monitoring will refine the forecast for individual reefs, but this assessment concludes that the global prognosis is unlikely to change without an accelerated effort to stabilize atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations.},

abstract = {An alcoholic beverage (35.4{\%} v/v ethanol) was produced by distillation of the fermented broth obtained by continuous whey fermentation with a lactose-fermenting yeast Kluyveromyces marxianus. Forty volatile compounds were identified in this drink by gas chromatography. Higher alcohols were the most abundant group of volatile compounds present, with isoamyl, isobutyl, 1-propanol, and isopentyl alcohols being found in highest quantities (887, 542, 266, and 176 mg/l, respectively). Ethyl acetate had the highest concentration (138 mg/l) among the esters. Besides higher alcohols and esters, other components, including aldehydes, acids and terpenes were also identified in the whey spirit. Considering that the quality of an alcoholic beverage can be evaluated by the relation between isoamyl alcohol/2-methyl-1-propanol and 2-methyl-1-propanol/1-propanol, which have to be higher than unity, it was concluded that a novel spirit of acceptable organoleptic characteristics can be produced by cheese whey continuous fermentation with K. marxianus. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {European governments have banned the use of three common neonicotinoid pesticides due to insufficiently identified risks to bees. This policy decision is controversial given the absence of clear consistency between toxicity assessments of those substances in the laboratory and in the field. Although laboratory trials report deleterious effects in honeybees at trace levels, field surveys reveal no decrease in the performance of honeybee colonies in the vicinity of treated fields. Here we provide the missing link, showing that individual honeybees near thiamethoxam-treated fields do indeed disappear at a faster rate, but the impact of this is buffered by the colonies' demographic regulation response. Although we could ascertain the exposure pathway of thiamethoxam residues from treated flowers to honeybee dietary nectar, we uncovered an unexpected pervasive co-occurrence of similar concentrations of imidacloprid, another neonicotinoid normally restricted to non-entomophilous crops in the study country. Thus, its origin and transfer pathways through the succession of annual crops need be elucidated to conveniently appraise the risks of combined neonicotinoid exposures. This study reconciles the conflicting laboratory and field toxicity assessments of neonicotinoids on honeybees and further highlights the difficulty in actually detecting non-intentional effects on the field through conventional risk assessment methods.},

abstract = {When microbes evolve in a nutrient-limited environment, natural selection can be predicted to favor genetic changes that give cells greater access to limiting substrate. We analyzed a population of baker's yeast that underwent 450 generations of glucose-limited growth. Relative to the strain used as the inoculum, the predominant cell type at the end of this experiment sustains growth at significantly lower steady-state glucose concentrations and demonstrates markedly enhanced cell yield per mole glucose, significantly enhanced high-affinity glucose transport, and greater relative fitness in pairwise competition. These changes are correlated with increased levels of mRNA hybridizing to probe generated from the hexose transport locus HXT6. Further analysis of the evolved strain reveals the existence of multiple tandem duplications involving two highly similar, high-affinity hexose transport loci, HXT6 and HXT7. Selection appears to have favored changes that result in the formation of more than three chimeric genes derived from the upstream promoter of the HXT gene and the coding sequence of HXT6. We propose a genetic mechanism to account for these changes and speculate as to their adaptive significance in the context of gene duplication as a common response of microorganisms to nutrient limitation.},

The paper examines various different conceptual active layer systems, identifying five active layer types: bedrock (Type I), rock glacier or debris covered (Type II), mineral soil (Type III), organic mat or soil (Type IV) and submerged (Type V) active layer systems. These systems can be independent or mixed (frequently) in a permafrost environment, but all respond differently to climatic change or disturbance based on the thermal properties of the material and ice/water content. The review also highlights various active layer monitoring techniques including: probing, the Circumpolar Active Layer Monitoring Program (CALM) and frost tubes. Active layer modelling techniques are also reviewed, including the Stefan and the Kudryavtsev equations. In addition, the study highlights the active layer in a changing climate, examining the sensitivities of this layer to changes in temperature, precipitation and surface changes. Although the active layer has been well studied, knowledge gaps still exist including conflicting definitions between the thermal definition (0°C) and the physical definition (frozen water), which can become significant in areas with pore water that contains high levels of dissolved solids. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2013.},

abstract = {Nitrate (NO 3 -) is a form of inorganic nitrogen (N) naturally occurring in soils. Sources of soil NO 3 -include decomposing plant residues and animal manure/compost, chemical fertilizers, exudates from living plants, rainfall, and lightning. Eventually, nitrate ions immobilized by microorganisms (nitrate taken up by microorganisms) are converted into organic forms and released back to the soil in plant-available forms when dead soil organisms are fed upon or decompose. In well drained soils, ammonium (NH 4 +) and ammonia (NH 3) are converted into NO 3 by very specific populations of aerobic bacteria. This process is known as nitrification. Another biological N transformation is denitrification, which is the conversion of NO 3 -into nitrous oxide (N 2 O), nitrogen dioxide (NO 2), and nitrogen gas (N 2) that often occurs in anaerobic soils, such as waterlogged soils and wetlands. Even when nitrifying bacteria are very active in the outer parts of aggregates in well aerated soils, denitrification may still occur in anaerobic microsites inside the aggregates. Nitrate is very soluble in water and can be easily transported by runoff and other surface and subsurface flows to rivers and lakes or moved downward to ground water.},

abstract = {The dynamics of adaptation determine which mutations fix in a population, and hence how reproducible evolution will be. This is central to understanding the spectra of mutations recovered in the evolution of antibiotic resistance, the response of pathogens to immune selection, and the dynamics of cancer progression. In laboratory evolution experiments, demonstrably beneficial mutations are found repeatedly, but are often accompanied by other mutations with no obvious benefit. Here we use whole-genome whole-population sequencing to examine the dynamics of genome sequence evolution at high temporal resolution in 40 replicate Saccharomyces cerevisiae populations growing in rich medium for 1,000 generations. We find pervasive genetic hitchhiking: multiple mutations arise and move synchronously through the population as mutational 'cohorts'. Multiple clonal cohorts are often present simultaneously, competing with each other in the same population. Our results show that patterns of sequence evolution are driven by a balance between these chance effects of hitchhiking and interference, which increase stochastic variation in evolutionary outcomes, and the deterministic action of selection on individual mutations, which favours parallel evolutionary solutions in replicate populations. {\textcopyright} 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Sugar concentration of the feed CWP solution varied between 55 and 200 g l-1 while the hydraulic residence time (HRT) was kept constant at 54 h. Ethanol formation, sugar utilization and biomass formation were investigated as functions of the feed sugar concentration. Percent sugar utilization and biomass concentrations decreased and the effluent sugar concentration increased with increasing feed sugar concentrations especially for the feed sugar contents above 100 g l-1. Ethanol concentration and productivity (DP) increased with increasing feed sugar up to 100 g l-1 and then decreased with further increases in the feed sugar content. The highest ethanol concentration (3.7{\%}, v v-1) and productivity (0.54 gE l-1 h-1) were obtained with the feed sugar content of 100 g l-1 or 125 g l-1. The ethanol yield coefficient (YP/S) was also maximum (0.49 gE gS-1) when the feed sugar was between 100 and 125 g l-1. The growth yield coefficient (YX/S) decreased steadily from 0.123 to 0.063 gX gS-1 when the feed sugar increased from 55 to 200 g l-1 due to adverse effects of high sugar contents on yeast growth. The optimal feed sugar concentration maximizing the ethanol productivity and sugar utilization was between 100 and 125 g l-1 under the specified experimental conditions. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The impact to the permafrost during and after wildfire was studied using 11 boreal forest fire sites including two controlled burns. Heat transfer by conduction to the permafrost was not significant during fire. Immediately following fire, ground thermal conductivity may increase 10-fold and the surface albedo can decrease by 50{\%} depending on the extent of burning of the surficial organic soil. The thickness of the remaining organic layer strongly affects permafrost degradation and aggradation. If the organic layer thickness was not reduced during the burn, then the active layer (the layer of soil above permafrost that annually freezes and thaws) did not change after the burn in spite of the surface albedo decrease. Any significant disturbance to the surface organic layer will increase heat flow through the active layer into the permafrost. Approximately 3-5 years after severe disturbance and depending on site conditions, the active layer will increase to a thickness that does not completely refreeze the following winter. This results in formation of a talik (an unfrozen layer below the seasonally frozen soil and above the permafrost). A thawed layer (4.15 m thick) was observed at the 1983 burned site. Model studies suggest that if an organic layer of more than 7-12 cm remains following a wildfire then the thermal impact to the permafrost will be minimal in the boreal forests of Interior Alaska.},

abstract = {The accident at the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant released a large quantity of radioactive iodine and caesium into the environment. In terms of radiological protection, the evacuation and food restrictions that were adopted in a timely manner by the authorities effectively reduced the dose received by people living in the affected area. Since late March, the transition from an emergency to an existing exposure situation has been in progress. In selecting the reference exposure levels in some areas under an existing exposure situation, the authorities tried to follow the situation-based approach recommended by the ICRP. However, a mixture of emergency and post-emergency approaches confused the people living in the contaminated areas because the reactor conditions continued to be not completely stable. In deriving the criteria in an existing exposure situation, the regulatory authority selected 20 mSvy -1. The mothers in the affected area believed that a dose of 20 mSvy -1 was unacceptably high for children since 1mSvy -1 is the dose limit for the public under normal conditions. Internet information accelerated concern about the internal exposure to children and the related health effects. From some experiences after the accident the following lessons could be learned. The selection of reference doses in existing exposure situations after an accident must be openly communicated with the public using a risk-informed approach. The detriment-adjusted nominal risk coefficient was misused for calculating the hypothetical number of cancer deaths by some non-radiation experts. It would not be possible to resolve this problem unless the ICRP addressed an alternative risk assessment to convey the meaning and associated uncertainty of the risk to an exposed population. A situation-based approach in addition to a risk-informed approach needs to be disseminated properly in order to select the level of protection that would be the best possible under the prevailing circumstances. A dialogue between radiation and other risk experts such as those dealing with chemical exposures is now needed. {\textcopyright} 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Accumulation of thin stillage (TS), a byproduct resulting from ethanol production, has led to a need to explore all possible means of its utilization. The objective of this research was to evaluate the effectiveness of TS derived from wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-based ethanol production plant as a fertilizer. The experiment was conducted over a 2-year period in east-central Saskatchewan, Canada. Treatments included three rates of TS: 50, 100, and 200 kg N ha−1 using two methods of application: broadcast, and incorporation and injection. For comparison, conventional fertilizer urea (46-0-0) was applied at the same rates of N as the TS. Responses of crop yield (wheat and canola (Brassica napus L.), N and P uptake, and apparent N recovery were measured over two growing seasons on a Black Chernozemic soil. For both seasons, at equivalent N rate, the TS produced similar or greater crop yield and nutrient recovery compared to urea fertilizer, especially when injected. This is caused by the presence of other plant nutrients, such as P and S in TS, and its relatively high plant-available NH4+-N content. The injection of TS appears to be a more effective application method compared to broadcasting, likely through reducing volatile N loss and placing nutrients closer to the growing crop roots when injected in bands in soil. The TS did not show any adverse effect on measured crop parameters even at the high rate of application. The results of this study suggest that land application of TS can be an effective solution for TS management that recycles nutrients in the feedstock grain for the ethanol production.},

Each food was collected from 18 supermarkets in 9 metropolitan cities in Korea, and then made into composite. According to food composition and alcohol content, samples were divided into four matrices such as apple juice, milk, Soju (liquor containing about 20{\%} alcohol), and rice porridge. The maximum EC value of 151.06 $\mu$g/kg was found in Maesilju (liquor made from Maesil and Soju). Whisky and Bokbunjaju (Korean black raspberry wine) contained 9.90 $\mu$g/kg and 6.30 $\mu$g/kg, respectively. EC was not detected in other alcoholic beverages. Of 20 fermented foods, Japanese-style soy sauce had highest level of 15.59 $\mu$g/kg and traditional one contained 4.18 $\mu$g/kg. Soybean paste had 1.18 $\mu$g/kg, however, EC was not found in other fermented foods.},

Acclimatisation of the strain through continuous culture at ethanol concentrations up to 80 g L-1, shifted the maximum ethanol concentration at which growth was observed from 40 g L-1 to 70 g L-1. Four isolates were selected from the continuous culture, only one of which produced a significant increase in final ethanol concentration (50 ± 0.4 g L-1), however in subsequent fermentations, following storage on nutrient agar plates, the maximum ethanol concentration was comparable with the original isolate. The maximum specific ethanol production rates (approximately 1.5 g (gh)-1) were also comparable with the original strain except for one isolate (0.7 g (gh)-1). The specific ethanol productivity decreased with ethanol concentration; this decrease correlated linearly (rval 0.92) with cell viability. Due to the translence of induced ethanol tolerance in the strain it was concluded that this was not a valid method for improving final ethanol concentrations or production rates.},

We then describe transformative developments that we did not anticipate, most of which followed the publication of the complete genomic sequence of Saccharomyces cerevisiae in 1996. In the intervening 23 years it appears to us that yeast has graduated from a position as the premier model for eukaryotic cell biology to become the pioneer organism that has facilitated the establishment of the entirely new fields of study called "functional genomics" and "systems biology."

The increase in lactose concentration increased ethanol yield and ethanol volumetric productivity, and has reduced cell yield. When lactose concentration was equal or above 50 g L-1 and the oxygen levels were low, the ethanol yield was close to its theoretical value. Maximum ethanol concentrations attained in this study were 76 and 80 g L-1 in hipoxia and anoxia, respectively. The lactose consumption rate in anoxia was greater than in aerobiosis and hipoxia. However, under anoxia, the lactose consumption rate of K. marxianus followed a saturation kinetics, which was not observed in hypoxia and aerobiosis. All oxygen levels investigated, showed a tendency for saturation of the ethanol production rate above 65 g L-1 lactose. Ethanol production rate was also higher on anoxia. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Hazard development in these areas is affected by process interactions and chain reactions, the ongoing shift of cryospheric hazard zones due to atmospheric warming, the large spatial scales involved and the remoteness of many permafrost-related threats. This paper reviews ground-based, airborne and spaceborne remote sensing methods suitable for permafrost hazard assessment and management. A wide range of image classification and change detection techniques support permafrost hazard studies. Digital terrain models (DTMs) derived from optical stereo, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) or laser scanning data are some of the most important data sets for investigating permafrost-related mass movements, thaw and heave processes, and hydrologcal hazards. Mulit-temporal optical or SAR data are used to derive surface displacements on creeping and unstable frozen slopes. Combining STMs with results from spectral image classification, and with multi-temporal data from change detection and displacement measurements significantly improves the detection of hazard potential.},

All but cyanobacteria toxin poisonings (CTPs) are mainly a marine occur- rence. CTPs occur in fresh (lakes, ponds, rivers and reservoirs) and brackish (seas, estuaries, and lakes) waters throughout the world. Organisms responsible include an estimated 40 genera but the main ones are Anabaena, Aphanizomenon, Cylindrospermopsis, Lyngbya, Microcystis, Nostoc, and Oscillatoria (Planktothrix). Cyanobacteria toxins (cyanotoxins) include cytotoxins and biotoxins with biotoxins being responsible for acute lethal, acute, chronic and sub-chronic poisonings of wild/domestic animals and humans. The biotoxins include the neurotoxins; ana- toxin-a, anatoxin-a(s) and saxitoxins plus the hepatotoxins; microcystins, nodularins and cylindrospermopsins. Confirmations of human deaths from cyanotoxins are limited to exposure through renal dialysis at a haemodialysis center in Caruaru, Brazil, in 1996. A major effort to compile all available information on toxic cyanobacteria including issues of human health, safe water practices, management, prevention and remediation have been published by the World Health Organiza- tion.

Despite the potential of non-Saccharomyces strains for alcoholic fermentation, few studies have been performed at industrial level with these yeasts. Therefore, in this work, Agave tequilana juice was fermented at an industrial level using two non-Saccharomyces yeasts (Pichia kluyveri and Kluyveromyces marxianus) with fermentation efficiency higher than 85 {\%}. Pichia kluyveri (GRO3) was more efficient for alcohol and ethyl lactate production than S. cerevisiae (AR5), while Kluyveromyces marxianus (GRO6) produced more isobutanol and ethyl-acetate than S. cerevisiae (AR5). The level of volatile compounds at the end of fermentation was compared with the tequila standard regulation. All volatile compounds were within the allowed range except for methanol, which was higher for S. cerevisiae (AR5) and K. marxianus (GRO6). The variations in methanol may have been caused by the Agave tequilana used for the tests, since this compound is not synthesized by these yeasts. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract = {Ground thermal conditions following a forest fire in 1994 were investigated along a hillslope transect in the discontinuous permafrost zone adjacent to a pipeline right of way in the central Mackenzie Valley, NWT, Canada. The intensity of the burn and damage to the forest and organic layer were more severe in the upper part of the slope than the bottom. Analysis of ground temperature records between 1995 and 2012 indicates that post-fire changes to the surface altered the ground temperature regime, likely by allowing more snow to accumulate on the ground in winter (as interception by coniferous trees ceased) and decreasing albedo and evapotranspiration in summer. Active layer thickness at the affected site doubled between 1995 and 1998, before stabilising. Permafrost degradation likely occurred at the top of the slope, where burning was most severe. Towards the end of the study period, ground surface temperatures in the upper portion of the slope were lower than they were post fire (1997), whereas the surface temperatures were higher in the lower portion of the slope. In contrast, little to no change in surface temperature was observed for the Unburnt site. These changes in the burned sites are attributed to the increased re-establishment of aspen, willow and tamarack in the upper part of the transect. Permafrost appears to be recovering at all burned sites in response to ongoing vegetation succession (except at the top of the slope), which is important for maintaining permafrost under conditions of projected climate warming in this boreal environment.

Only for ethanol concentrations near the maximal for growth [range 5-7{\%} (v/v) for K. marxianus and 8-10{\%} (v/v) for S. cerevisiae], the ATPase activity reached values below those in cells grown in the absence of added ethanol. Plasma membrane ATPase activity was approximately 200 nmol Pi min-1 mg-1 in cells of both strains grown with the maximal concentration of ethanol that allowed balanced growth [7{\%} or 10{\%} (v/v)]. This value was about 23{\%} of the maximal level attained (900 nmol Pi min-1 mg-1 for both strains) when plasma membrane ATPase was fully activated by ethanol [3{\%} or 6{\%} (v/v), respectively for the low- or the high-ethanol tolerant strain]. A correlation was established between plasma membrane ATPase activity in cells grown with ethanol and their ethanol tolerance using as a criterion its inhibitory effects on growth. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

abstract = {Ileal pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA) may have a significant impact on female sexuality and fertility. While most women report no change or even improved sexual function after IPAA, 9 to 25{\%} of women will experience a decrease in sexual satisfaction as a result of dysparunia, vaginal dryness, and incontinence during intercourse. Fertility is significantly decreased after IPAA and studies suggest that only 36 to 56{\%} of women who try to become pregnant after surgery will be successful. For those women who do become pregnant, pregnancy is safe with no associated increase in maternal or fetal mortality. A transient deterioration in frequency and continence is reported by some women during pregnancy and these problems typically resolve after delivery. Because of the potential for anal sphincter injury with vaginal delivery, there has been considerable debate regarding the preferred method of delivery after IPAA. Studies suggest that there is no difference in pouch function between women who have delivered vaginally and those who have had a planned caesarian section. However, the true rate of sphincter injury associated with vaginal delivery remains unclear and the long-term risk of incontinence after vaginal delivery is unknown. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The results of an experiment studying the effects of vinasse (an alcohol industry waste) recycling in agriculture are reported in this work. Vinasse was applied in a durum wheat crop by a trailed vinasse sprayer system compacting about 10{\%} of the field. The experiment was carried out in Central Greece, on two soils (a clay and a silty clay loam) with three levels of vinasse rate (one fully covering N requirements of the crop, one covering half the N requirements, the rest covered by chemical fertilizers and a control without vinasse and use only of chemical fertilizers) and three times of application (Summer, Autumn before ploughing and Autumn before drilling). The middle strip of the plots was compacted by three passes of the tractor-trailed vinasse sprayer producing the compacted treatment. During the experiment, the physical and chemical properties of the soil were measured as well as the plant growth and yield. It was found that the compacted plots had higher dry bulk density and soil strength, while vinasse rate and time of application effects were not significant. An increase in N, exchangeable Na+ , K+ and available Mn was caused by vinasse application. Compaction had a significant effect on plant growth, while vinasse rate and time of application effects were not significant. Yields were affected by weather conditions. In the compacted plots, the yields were generally lower but in the wet years they were also significant. Yields were higher at higher vinasse rates and lower for the application before ploughing in the autumn, indicating an adverse effect of that treatment. The combined analysis of the yields for the four years showed a significant adverse effect of compaction in the clay soil, while in the silty clay loam the effect was not significant. Vinasse application significantly increased yields, while an adverse effect was observed for the applications before ploughing. The work proved the beneficial effects of vinasse recycling as a substitute for chemical fertilizers and the feasibility of using of a spraying system, which compacts only the 10{\%} of the field, to reduce any adverse economic effect of soil compaction on the crop. {\textcopyright} 1999 Silsoe Research Institute.},

abstract = {The environmental risks of pesticides are typically determined by laboratory single-species tests based on OECD test guidelines, even if biodiversity should also be taken into consideration. To evaluate how realistic these assessments are, ecological changes caused by the systemic insecticides imidacloprid and fipronil, which have different physicochemical properties, when applied at recommended commercial rates on rice fields were monitored using experimental paddy mesocosms. A total of 178 species were observed. There were no significant differences in abundance of crop arthropods among the experimental paddies. However, zooplankton, benthic and neuston communities in imidacloprid-treated field had significantly less abundance of species than control and fipronil fields. Significant differences in abundance of nekton community were also found between both insecticide-treated paddies and control. Influences on the growth of medaka fish were also found in both adults and their fries. Both Principal Response Curve analysis (PRC) and Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA) showed the time series variations in community structure among treatments, in particular for imidacloprid during the middle stage of the experimental period. These results show the ecological effect-concentrations (LOEC {\~{}} 1 $\mu$g/l) of these insecticides in mesocosms, especially imidacloprid, are clearly different from their laboratory tests. We suggest that differences in the duration of the recovery process among groups of species are due to different physicochemical properties of the insecticides. Therefore, realistic prediction and assessment of pesticide effects at the community level should consider not only the sensitivity traits and interaction among species but also the differences in physicochemical characteristics of each pesticide. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract = {Freshwater lakes are biologically sensitive to changes in the surrounding environment and the impacts that such changes have on their water quality are of considerable ecological, recreational and economic importance. In this study the phytoplankton community model, PROTECH, was used to experiment with the effects of elevated temperatures and increased nutrient load on phytoplankton succession and productivity. The response of a phytoplankton community to combined incremental changes in these drivers was analysed, in order to elucidate the resulting ecological changes. Annual mean phytoplankton biomass increased with increases in temperature and nutrient loading, although the latter had the larger effect. The phenology of the dominant phytoplankton taxa changed with increasing water temperature; the three spring blooming species all peaked earlier in the year. The simulated summer bloom of Anabaena became earlier in the year and the Chlorella bloom later. The increased phytoplankton biomass was largely dominated by the cyanobacterium Anabaena, which was especially prevalent during the summer bloom. This resulted in a progressive loss of phytoplankton biodiversity with increasing water temperature and nutrient supply. Model experimentation showed that whilst both factors greatly affected the community, the changes to nutrient loading generally had the greater effect and that at low nutrient levels the effect of water temperature change was reduced considerably. Finally, the model predicted that cyanobacteria have the potential to dominate the phytoplankton community, with clear consequences for water quality, and that this dominance was at its greatest when high water temperatures were combined with high nutrient loads},

abstract = {In 1988 McCusker and Haber generated a series of mutants which are resistant to the minimum inhibitory concentration of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. These cycloheximide-resistant, temperature-sensitive (crl) mutants, in addition, exhibited other pleiotropic phenotypes, e.g., incorrect response to starvation, hypersensitivity against amino acid analogues, and other protein synthesis inhibitors. Temperature sensitivity of one of these mutants, crl3-2, had been found to be suppressed by a mutation, SCL1-1, which resided in an $\alpha$-type subunit of the 20S proteasome. We cloned the CRL3 gene by complementation and found CRL3 to be identical to the SUG1/CIM3 gene coding for a subunit of the 19S cap complex of the 26S proteasome. Another mutation, crl21, revealed to be allelic with the 20S proteasomal gene PRE3. crl3-2 and crl21 mutant cells show significant defects in proteasome-dependent proteolysis, whereas the SCL1-1 suppressor mutation causes partial restoration of crl3-2-induced proteolytic defects. Notably, cycloheximide resistance was also detected for other proteolytically deficient proteasome mutants (pre1-1, pre2-1, pre3-1, pre4-1). Moreover, proteasomal genes were found within genomic sequences of 9 of 13 chromosomal loci to which crl mutations had been mapped. We therefore assume that most if not all crl mutations reside in the proteasome and that phenotypes found are a result of defective protein degradation.},

We investigated public perception of the risks from low dose radiation and the role of information providers through the Internet survey focusing on parents in four Japanese regional groups. Mothers felt more anxious than fathers in Fukushima but not in further groups, and that the furthest group felt the most ambiguous anxiety. Their anxiety derived from distrust of the government and uncertainty about scientific information, rather than the lack of knowledge although risk communication emphasized learning the scientific mechanism. The mediators should provide more information for individual decision-making of day-to-day risk management in regions with different levels of radiological contamination; key issues include improving parents' perceived control to their lives and easing their tension of responsibility to children's health.},

abstract = {Since the 1970s the area under sugarcane in Brazil has increased from 2 million to over 5 million ha (M ha), and it is expected to pass the 7 M ha mark in 2007. More than half of the cane is harvested to produce bioethanol as a fuel for light vehicles. The distilleries produce approximately 13 L of distillery waste (vinasse) for each litre of ethanol produced. In the 1980s there was considerable concern over the long-term effects of the disposal of this material (containing about 1{\%} carbon and high in K) on cane yields if it was applied to the field. At the same time there was a growing movement to abandon the practice of pre-harvest burning and some research was showing that some Brazilian varieties of sugar cane were able to obtain significant contributions of N from plant-associated biological nitrogen fixation (BNF). For these reasons an experiment was installed on a cane plantation in the state of Pernambuco, NE Brazil to investigate the long-term effects of vinasse and N fertiliser additions and the practice of pre-harvest burning on crop and sugar yield, soil fertility parameters, N balance and soil C stocks. The results showed that over a 16-year period, trash conservation (abandonment of burning) increased cane yields by 25{\%} from a mean of 46 to 58 Mg ha-1. Vinasse applications (80 m3 ha-1 crop-1) increased mean cane and sugar yield by 12 to 13{\%} and the application of 80 kg N ha-1 as urea increased cane yields by 9{\%}, but total sugar yield by less than 6{\%} (from 7.0 to 7.4 Mg ha-1 crop-1). The total N balance for the soil/plant system when only the surface 20 cm of the soil was considered was positive in plots where no N fertiliser was added. However, the data indicated that during the 16 years of the study considerable quantities of soil organic matter were accumulated below 20 cm depth such that the N balance considering the soil to 60 cm depth was strongly positive, except where N fertiliser was added. The data indicated that there were considerable BNF inputs to the system, which was consistent with its low response to N fertiliser and low N fertiliser-use-efficiency. There were no significant effects of vinasse or urea addition, or trash conservation on soil C stocks, although the higher yields proportioned by trash conservation had potentially significant benefits for increased mitigation of CO2 emissions where the main use of the cane was for bioethanol production. {\textcopyright} Springer 2006.},

abstract = {Late-onset effects of exposure to ionising radiation on the human body have been identified by long-term, large-scale epidemiological studies. The cohort study of Japanese survivors of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki (the Life Span Study) is thought to be the most reliable source of information about these health effects because of the size of the cohort, the exposure of a general population of both sexes and all ages, and the wide range of individually assessed doses. For this reason, the Life Span Study has become fundamental to risk assessment in the radiation protection system of the International Commission on Radiological Protection and other authorities. Radiation exposure increases the risk of cancer throughout life, so continued follow-up of survivors is essential. Overall, survivors have a clear radiation-related excess risk of cancer, and people exposed as children have a higher risk of radiation-induced cancer than those exposed at older ages. At high doses, and possibly at low doses, radiation might increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and some other non-cancer diseases. Hereditary effects in the children of atomic bomb survivors have not been detected. The dose-response relation for cancer at low doses is assumed, for purposes of radiological protection, to be linear without a threshold, but has not been shown definitively. This outstanding issue is not only a problem when dealing appropriately with potential health effects of nuclear accidents, such as at Fukushima and Chernobyl, but is of growing concern in occupational and medical exposure. Therefore, the appropriate dose-response relation for effects of low doses of radiation needs to be established.},

(Lepidoptera: Danaidae) larvae. Larvae feeding for 48 h on A. syriaca plants naturally dusted with pollen from Bt corn plants suffered significantly higher rates of mortality at 48 h (20±3{\%}) compared to larvae feeding on leaves with no pollen (3±3{\%}), or feeding on leaves with non-Bt pollen (0{\%}). Mortality at 120 h of D. plexippus larvae exposed to 135 pollen grains/cm2 of transgenic pollen for 48 h ranged from 37 to 70{\%}. We found no sub-lethal effects on D. plexippus adults reared from larvae that survived a 48-h exposure to three concentrations of Bt pollen. Based on our quantification of the wind dispersal of this pollen beyond the edges of agricultural fields, we predict that the effects of transgenic pollen on D. plexippus may be observed at least 10 m from transgenic field borders. However, the highest larval mortality will likely occur on A. syriaca plants in corn fields or within 3 m of the edge of a transgenic corn field. We conclude that the ecological effects of transgenic insecticidal crops need to be evaluated more fully before they are planted over extensive areas.},

abstract = {Background: The Chornobyl nuclear power plant explosion in April 1986 was one of the worst ecological disasters of the 20th century. As with most disasters, its long-term mental health consequences have not been examined.Aims: This study describes the psychological well-being and risk perceptions of exposed women 19-20 years later and the risk factors associated with mental health.Methods: We assessed Chornobyl-related post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), major depressive episode (MDE) and overall distress among three groups of women in Kyiv, Ukraine (N = 797): mothers of small children evacuated to Kyiv in 1986 from the contaminated area near the plant (evacuees); mothers of their children's classmates (neighbourhood controls); and population-based controls from Kyiv. Risk perceptions and epidemiologic correlates were also obtained.Results: Evacuees reported poorer well-being and more negative risk perceptions than controls. Group differences in psychological well-being remained after adjustment for epidemiologic risk factors but became non-significant when Chornobyl risk perceptions were added to the models.Conclusions: The relatively poorer psychological well-being among evacuees is largely explained by their continued concerns about the physical health risks stemming from the accident. We suggest that this is due to the long-term, non-resolvable nature of health fears associated with exposure. {\textcopyright} 2011 SAGE Publications.},

abstract = {Synthesis of results from several Arctic and boreal research programmes provides evidence for the strong role of high-latitude ecosystems in the climate system. Average surface air temperature has increased 0.3°C per decade during the twentieth century in the western North American Arctic and boreal forest zones. Precipitation has also increased, but changes in soil moisture are uncertain. Disturbance rates have increased in the boreal forest; for example, there has been a doubling of the area burned in North America in the past 20 years. The disturbance regime in tundra may not have changed. Tundra has a 3-6-fold higher winter albedo than boreal forest, but summer albedo and energy partitioning differ more strongly among ecosystems within either tundra or boreal forest than between these two biomes. This indicates a need to improve our understanding of vegetation dynamics within, as well as between, biomes. If regional surface warming were to continue, changes in albedo and energy absorption would likely act as a positive feedback to regional warming due to earlier melting of snow and, over the long term, the northward movement of treeline. Surface drying and a change in dominance from mosses to vascular plants would also enhance sensible heat flux and regional warming in tundra. In the boreal forest of western North America, deciduous forests have twice the albedo of conifer forests in both winter and summer, 50-80{\%} higher evapotranspiration, and therefore only 30-50{\%} of the sensible heat flux of conifers in summer. Therefore, a warming-induced increase in fire frequency that increased the proportion of deciduous forests in the landscape, would act as a negative feedback to regional warming. Changes in thermokarst and the aerial extent of wetlands, lakes, and ponds would alter high-latitude methane flux. There is currently a wide discrepancy among estimates of the size and direction of CO2 flux between high-latitude ecosystems and the atmosphere. These discrepancies relate more strongly to the approach and assumptions for extrapolation than to inconsistencies in the underlying data. Inverse modelling from atmospheric CO2 concentrations suggests that high latitudes are neutral or net sinks for atmospheric CO2, whereas field measurements suggest that high latitudes are neutral or a net CO2 source. Both approaches rely on assumptions that are difficult to verify. The most parsimonious explanation of the available data is that drying in tundra and disturbance in boreal forest enhance CO2 efflux. Nevertheless, many areas of both tundra and boreal forests remain net sinks due to regional variation in climate and local variation in topographically determined soil moisture. Improved understanding of the role of high-latitude ecosystems in the climate system requires a concerted research effort that focuses on geographical variation in the processes controlling land-atmosphere exchange, species composition, and ecosystem structure. Future studies must be conducted over a long enough time-period to detect and quantify ecosystem feedbacks.},

abstract = {Distillery effluent, a foul smelling, dark coloured by-product of distillery industries, is usually applied as irrigation water or as an amendment to arable land in some areas which are in the vicinity of the distillery industries. A field experiment on soybean-wheat system was conducted for 3 consecutive years in a Vertisol of central India to evaluate the effect of distillery effluent (DE) as an amendment on soil properties and crop productivity. The treatments were control (no fertilizer or manure or DE, T1), 100{\%} NPK + FYM @ 4 Mg ha-1 to soybean (T2) and four graded levels of DE, viz.: 2.5 cm DE to soybean and wheat on residual nutrition (T3), 2.5 cm DE to soybean and 1.25 cm to wheat (T4), 5 cm DE to soybean and wheat on residual nutrition (T5), 5 cm DE to soybean and 2.5 cm to wheat (T6). The organic carbon, microbial biomass carbon and electrical conductivity (EC) of the surface (0-10 cm) soil increased significantly with application of DE compared to T1 and T2, but the soil pH was not affected. The EC increased from 0.47 dS m-1 and 0.58 dS m-1, respectively, in T1 and T2 to 1.52 dS m-1 in T6, where highest dose of DE was applied. This indicated a slight build-up of salinity with DE application. The application of DE showed a significant improvement in the physical properties of the soil. The mean weight diameter (MWD), saturated hydraulic conductivity, water retention at field capacity and available water content were significantly (P {\textless} 0.05) higher, while bulk density (BD) and penetration resistance of the surface soil were significantly lower (P {\textless} 0.05) in all DE treated plots except in T3 than those in T1 and T2. The fractions of WSA of more than 1 mm diameter in T6, T5 and T4 were, respectively, 141{\%}, 107{\%} and 116{\%} more than the control. The MWD showed a positive linear relationship with the organic carbon (r = 0.84**) and microbial biomass carbon (r = 0.90**) of the soil. A significant (P {\textless} 0.01) negative linear relationship (r = 0.70**) was found between soil organic carbon and BD. Except T3, all the DE treated plots recorded significantly higher total and microporosity of the soil than control. Water retention at permanent wilting point and macroporosity of the soil were not affected by treatment. The seed yield of soybean in all the DE treatments was similar with T2 (1.86 Mg ha-1) but significantly more than control (1.28 Mg ha-1). The DE application levels have not affected the seed yield of soybean. In wheat highest grain yield was recorded in T2 (3.47 Mg ha-1), which was similar with T4 (3.16 Mg ha-1), T5 (3.22 Mg ha-1) and T6 (3.46 Mg ha-1). DE application up to T4 level was found suitable from productivity, salinity and sustainability point of view. The study showed that judicious application of DE as an amendment to the agricultural field could be considered as a viable option for safe disposal of this industrial waste. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Recent studies have shown that neonicotinoid insecticides have adverse effects on non-target invertebrate species. Invertebrates constitute a substantial part of the diet of many bird species during the breeding season and are indispensable for raising offspring. We investigated the hypothesis that the most widely used neonicotinoid insecticide, imidacloprid, has a negative impact on insectivorous bird populations. Here we show that, in the Netherlands, local population trends were significantly more negative in areas with higher surface-water concentrations of imidacloprid. At imidacloprid concentrations of more than 20 nanograms per litre, bird populations tended to decline by 3.5 per cent on average annually. Additional analyses revealed that this spatial pattern of decline appeared only after the introduction of imidacloprid to the Netherlands, in the mid-1990s. We further show that the recent negative relationship remains after correcting for spatial differences in land-use changes that are known to affect bird populations in farmland. Our results suggest that the impact of neonicotinoids on the natural environment is even more substantial than has recently been reported and is reminiscent of the effects of persistent insecticides in the past. Future legislation should take into account the potential cascading effects of neonicotinoids on ecosystems. {\textcopyright} 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Predicting the bioavailability of inorganic mercury (Hg) to bacteria that produce the potent bioaccumulative neurotoxin monomethylmercury remains one of the greatest challenges in predicting the environmental fate and transport of Hg. Dissolved organic matter (DOM) affects mercury methylation due to its influence on cell physiology (as a potential nutrient) and its influence on HgII speciation in solution (as a complexing agent), therefore controlling Hg bioavailability. We assessed the role of DOM on HgII bioavailability to a gram-negative bacterium bioreporter under oxic pseudo- and nonequilibrium conditions, using defined media and field samples spanning a wide range of DOM levels. Our results showed that HgII was considerably more bioavailable under nonequilibrium conditions than when DOM was absent or when HgII and DOM had reached pseudoequilibrium (24 h) prior to cell exposure. Under these enhanced uptake conditions, HgII bioavailability followed a bell shaped curve as DOM concentrations increased, both for defined media and natural water samples, consistent with bioaccumulation results in a companion paper (this issue) observed for amphipods. Experiments also suggest that DOM may not only provide shuttle molecules facilitating Hg uptake, but also alter cell wall properties to facilitate the first steps toward HgII internalization. We propose the existence of a short-lived yet critical time window ({\textless}24 h) during which DOM facilitates the entry of newly deposited HgII into aquatic food webs, suggesting that the bulk of mercury incorporation in aquatic food webs would occur within hours following its deposition from the atmosphere.},

abstract = {Background: Increased infertility in women has been reported after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) for ulcerative colitis but reported infertility rates vary substantially. Aims: (1) To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis or the relative risk of infertility post-IPAA compared with medical management; (2) to estimate the rate of infertility post-IPAA; and (3) to identify modifiable risk factors which contribute to infertility. Methods: Medline, EMBASE, Current Contents, meeting abstracts, and bibliographies were searched independently by two investigators. The titles and abstracts of 189 potentially relevant studies were reviewed; eight met the criteria and all data were extracted independently. Consensus was achieved on each data point, and fixed effects meta-analyses, a funnel plot, and sensitivity analyses were performed. Results: The initial meta-analysis of eight studies had significant heterogeneity (p = 0.004) due to one study with very high preoperative infertility (38{\%}). When this study was omitted, the relative risk of infertility after IPAA was 3.17 (2.41-4.18), with non-significant heterogeneity. The weighted average infertility rate in medically treated ulcerative colitis was 15{\%} for all seven studies, and the weighted average infertility rate was 48{\%} after IPAA (50{\%} if all eight studies are included). We were unable to identify any procedural factors that consistently affected the risk of infertility. Conclusions: IPAA increases the risk of infertility in women with ulcerative colitis by approximately threefold. Infertility, defined as achieving pregnancy in 12 months of attempting conception, increased from 15{\%} to 48{\%} in women post-IPAA for ulcerative colitis. This provides a basis for counselling patients considering colectomy with IPAA. Further studies of modifiable risk factors are needed.},

However, the microorganism more widely used in industrial fermentation processes, the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, does not have a lactose metabolization system. Therefore, several metabolic engineering approaches have been used to construct lactose-consuming S. cerevisiae strains, particularly involving the expression of the lactose genes of the phylogenetically related yeast Kluyveromyces lactis, but also the lactose genes from Escherichia coli and Aspergillus niger, as reviewed here. Due to the existing large amounts of whey, the production of bio-ethanol from lactose by engineered S. cerevisiae has been considered as a possible route for whey surplus. Emphasis is given in the present review on strain improvement for lactose-to-ethanol bioprocesses, namely flocculent yeast strains for continuous high-cell-density systems with enhanced ethanol productivity. {\textcopyright} 2010 Landes Bioscience.},

abstract = {The thermotolerant yeast Kluyveromyces marxianus displays a potential to be used for ethanol production from both whey and lignocellulosic biomass at elevated temperatures, which is highly alluring to reduce the cost of the bioprocess. Nevertheless, contrary to Saccharomyces cerevisiae, K. marxianus cannot tolerate high ethanol concentrations. We report the transcriptional profile alterations in K. marxianus under ethanol stress in order to gain insights about mechanisms involved with ethanol response. Time-dependent changes have been characterized under the exposure of 6{\%} ethanol and compared with the unstressed cells prior to the ethanol addition. Our results reveal that the metabolic flow through the central metabolic pathways is impaired under the applied ethanol stress. Consistent with these results, we also observe that genes involved with ribosome biogenesis are downregulated and gene-encoding heat shock proteins are upregulated. Remarkably, the expression of some gene-encoding enzymes related to unsaturated fatty acid and ergosterol biosynthesis decreases upon ethanol exposure, and free fatty acid and ergosterol measurements demonstrate that their content in K. marxianus does not change under this stress. These results are in contrast to the increase previously reported with S. cerevisiae subjected to ethanol stress and suggest that the restructuration of K. marxianus membrane composition differs in the two yeasts which gives important clues to understand the low ethanol tolerance of K. marxianus compared to S. cerevisiae.},

abstract = {Bioethanol from sugarcane is becoming an increasingly important alternative energy source worldwide as it is considered to be both economically and environmentally sustainable. Besides being produced from a tropical perennial grass with high photosynthetic efficiency, sugarcane ethanol is commonly associated with low N fertilizer use because sugarcane from Brazil, the world's largest sugarcane producer, has a low N demand. In recent years, several models have predicted that the use of sugarcane ethanol in replacement to fossil fuel could lead to high greenhouse gas (GHG) emission savings. However, empirical data that can be used to validate model predictions and estimates from indirect methodologies are scarce, especially with regard to emissions associated with different fertilization methods and agricultural management practices commonly used in sugarcane agriculture in Brazil. In this study, we provide in situ data on emissions of three GHG (CO2, N2O, and CH4) from sugarcane soils in Brazil and assess how they vary with fertilization methods and management practices. We measured emissions during the two main phases of the sugarcane crop cycle (plant and ratoon cane), which include different fertilization methods and field conditions. Our results show that N2O and CO2 emissions in plant cane varied significantly depending on the fertilization method and that waste products from ethanol production used as organic fertilizers with mineral fertilizer, as it is the common practice in Brazil, increase emission rates significantly. Cumulatively, the highest emissions were observed for ratoon cane treated with vinasse (liquid waste from ethanol production) especially as the amount of crop trash on the soil surface increased. Emissions of CO2 and N2O were 6.9 kg ha-1 yr-1 and 7.5 kg ha-1 yr-1, respectively, totaling about 3000 kg in CO2 equivalent ha-1 yr-1. {\textcopyright} 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {An intracellular accumulation of ethanol in Saccharomyces cerevisiae was observed during the early stages of fermentation (3 h). However, after 12 h of fermentation, the intracellular and extracellular ethanol concentrations were similar. Increasing the osmotic pressure of the medium caused an increase in the ratio of intracellular to extracellular ethanol concentrations at 3 h of fermentation. As in the previous case, the intracellular and extracellular ethanol concentrations were similar after 12 h of fermentation. Increasing the osmotic pressure also caused a decrease in yeast cell growth and fermentation activities. However, nutrient supplementation of the medium increased the extent of growth and fermentation, resulting in complete glucose utilization, even though intracellular ethanol concentrations were unaltered. These results suggest that nutrient limitation is a major factor responsible for the decreased growth and fermentation activities observed in yeast cells at higher osmotic pressures.},

abstract = {Most microorganisms adapted to life in milk owe their ability to thrive in this habitat to the evolution of mechanisms for the use of the most abundant sugar present on it, lactose, as a carbon source. Because of their lactose-assimilating ability, Kluyveromyces yeasts have long been used in industrial processes involved in the elimination of this sugar. The identification of the genes conferring Kluyveromyces with a system for permeabilization and intracellular hydrolysis of lactose (LAC genes), along with the current possibilities for their transfer into alternative organisms through genetic engineering, has significantly broadened the industrial profitability of lactic yeasts. This review provides an updated overview of the general properties of Kluyveromyces LAC genes, and the multiple techniques involving their biotechnological utilization. Emphasis is also made on the potential that some of the latest technologies, such as the generation of transgenics, will have for a further benefit in the use of these and related genes. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Permafrost soils contain enormous amounts of organic carbon, which could act as a positive feedback to global climate change due to enhanced respiration rates with warming. We have used a terrestrial ecosystem model that includes permafrost carbon dynamics, inhibition of respiration in frozen soil layers, vertical mixing of soil carbon from surface to permafrost layers, and CH(4) emissions from flooded areas, and which better matches new circumpolar inventories of soil carbon stocks, to explore the potential for carbon-climate feedbacks at high latitudes. Contrary to model results for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report (IPCC AR4), when permafrost processes are included, terrestrial ecosystems north of 60°N could shift from being a sink to a source of CO(2) by the end of the 21st century when forced by a Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) A2 climate change scenario. Between 1860 and 2100, the model response to combined CO(2) fertilization and climate change changes from a sink of 68 Pg to a 27 + -7 Pg sink to 4 + -18 Pg source, depending on the processes and parameter values used. The integrated change in carbon due to climate change shifts from near zero, which is within the range of previous model estimates, to a climate-induced loss of carbon by ecosystems in the range of 25 + -3 to 85 + -16 Pg C, depending on processes included in the model, with a best estimate of a 62 + -7 Pg C loss. Methane emissions from high-latitude regions are calculated to increase from 34 Tg CH(4)/y to 41-70 Tg CH(4)/y, with increases due to CO(2) fertilization, permafrost thaw, and warming-induced increased CH(4) flux densities partially offset by a reduction in wetland extent.},

abstract = {Kluyveromyces marxianus is homothallic hemiascomycete yeast frequently isolated from dairy environments. It possesses phenotypic traits such as enhanced thermotolerance, inulinase production, and rapid growth rate that distinguish it from its closest relative Kluyveromyces lactis. Certain of these traits, notably fermentation of lactose and inulin to ethanol, make this yeast attractive for industrial production of ethanol from inexpensive substrates. There is relatively little known, however, about the diversity in this species, at the genetic, metabolic or physiological levels. This study compared phenotypic traits of 13 K. marxianus strains sourced from two European Culture Collections. A wide variety of responses to thermo, osmotic, and cell wall stress were observed, with some strains showing multi-stress resistance. These traits generally appeared unlinked indicating that, as with other yeasts, multiple resistance/adaptation pathways are present in K. marxianus. The data indicate that it should be possible to identify the molecular basis of traits to facilitate selection or engineering of strains adapted for industrial environments. The loci responsible for mating were also identified by genome sequencing and PCR analysis. It was found that K. marxianus can exist as stable haploid or diploid cells, opening up additional prospects for future strain engineering. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {Background: Model organisms are used for research because they provide a framework on which to develop and optimize methods that facilitate and standardize analysis. Such organisms should be representative of the living beings for which they are to serve as proxy. However, in practice, a model organism is often selected ad hoc, and without considering its representativeness, because a systematic and rational method to include this consideration in the selection process is still lacking. Methodology/Principal Findings: In this work we propose such a method and apply it in a pilot study of strengths and limitations of Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model organism. The method relies on the functional classification of proteins into different biological pathways and processes and on full proteome comparisons between the putative model organism and other organisms for which we would like to extrapolate results. Here we compare S. cerevisiae to 704 other organisms from various phyla. For each organism, our results identify the pathways and processes for which S. cerevisiae is predicted to be a good model to extrapolate from. We find that animals in general and Homo sapiens in particular are some of the nonfungal organisms for which S. cerevisiae is likely to be a good model in which to study a significant fraction of common biological processes. We validate our approach by correctly predicting which organisms are phenotypically more distant from S. cerevisiae with respect to several different biological processes. Conclusions/Significance: The method we propose could be used to choose appropriate substitute model organisms for the study of biological processes in other species that are harder to study. For example, one could identify appropriate models to study either pathologies in humans or specific biological processes in species with a long development time, such as plants. {\textcopyright} 2011 Karathia et al.},
