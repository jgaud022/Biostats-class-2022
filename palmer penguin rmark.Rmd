# Practical one  
Report done on  
__palmer penguins__



```{r echo=FALSE}
library(palmerpenguins)
data(package='palmerpenguins')
```

## new section
There are `r nrow(penguins)` penguins spread out on `r length(unique(penguins$island))` islands and there is `r length(unique(penguins$species))` species  
 ( not a appostrophe but a accent grave for the inline code)  
 
#### means of penguin traits 

```{r echo = FALSE}
penguins %>%
  group_by(species) %>%
  summarize(across(where(is.numeric), mean, na.rm = TRUE))
```

#### graphical exploration
```{r, fig.cap="Bodymass distribution by penguin species"}
penguins %>%
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = body_mass_g) +
  geom_histogram(aes(fill = species),
                 alpha = 0.5,
                 position = "identity") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("blue","yellow","brown")) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Body mass (g)",
       y = "Frequency",
       title = "Penguin body mass")
```
#### Linear regression

```{r, fig.cap = "Checking assumptions of the model"}
m1 <- lm(bill_length_mm ~  flipper_length_mm + body_mass_g + sex, data = penguins)
summary(m1)
par(mfrow= c(2,2))
plot(m1)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
